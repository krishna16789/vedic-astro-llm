Subrahmanya Sastri B.A.\n\n   Uttara Kalamritam by Kalidasa Edited by Chistabo, May 2012   \n INTRODUCTION\n\nPresent is one more addition to existing literature, pertaining to great and celestial science of Astrology. Many\nordinary incidents in life, which we pass by and notice not, as well as phenomena of nature, are easily\nexplained with reference to Astrology. There have been indications of it in works which I have previously\ntranslated, viz. Brihat Jataka, Jatakaparijata, Sripati Paddhati and Phaladeepika, works by giants of Astrology.\nAs an instance of influence of phenomena of nature on human life, reference may be made to rainbow caused\nby refraction of Surya’s rays through a watery prism, consisting of particles of rain water. Rainbow is produced\non a morning or on an evening, i.e. when Surya is at Lagna or Astha Lagna. Then, when Surya is at Lagna\n(rising Rasi or Ascendant), seventh Rasi is encircled by beautiful circles of seven variegated colors on a watery\nplane. Even so, rising Rasi is encircled by circles of like nature, when Surya is posited in 7th Rasi. Lagna\nrepresents native, while seventh Rasi denotes partner of native. Life of native will be happy, cordial and jovial if\nthere be a sympathetic, loving and understanding support from partner. Seven colors of rainbow represent\nseven Grahas, who by various combinations produce seven kinds of energy or seven modes of motion that are\nfound common in Universe.",

This work is ascribed to Kalidasa of court of Vikramasurya, itself a proper name suggesting\nVikrama of solar race. A part of work is called Kalidasa Krita and indeed Sri V. Suryanarayana Siddhantigaru,\nwho has published original work in Telugu characters, describes this as an astrological work of Maha Kavi\nKalidasa, giving a colophon at the end of each chapter in Telugu, that this Uttarakalamritam was work of Sri\nKalidasa. It is not possible to say whether any Kalidasa was author of this work. In any case, author of this\nwork, important as it is in field of Astrology, ought not to be confused and mixed up or identified with\nimmortal poet of that name, as even intrinsic evidence is against it.\n\nValue of work will be evident from information available in it, with reference to (1) three births – past, present\nand future, with detailed references concerning longevity; (2) special kinds of Rajayogas and their Bhangas; (3)\nsolar year and its delineation, effects of Varshika Dasas of several Grahas; (4) importance attached to Rahu and\nKetu; (5) Nimita or Muhurta for inauguration post etc., enterprise or a ceremonial – Cf.

    "output": "First Pada mentions owners of first eight Rasis, while a separate Pada has been allotted to mention Lords of\nremaining four Rasis. The idea contained here is to show the line of demarcation between first eight Rasis and\nlast four Rasis. First eight Rasis signify all aspects of native from birth to death, i.e. material ones. Last four\ndenote following qualities, viz. Dharma / Tapas / fame / gain / Moksha. In fact, these four Rasis represent\nDharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. Here Artha and Kama should not be taken in material sense. They play\ntheir part only so far as they help native to attain salvation. Now last four Rasis are owned by Guru and Sani\nand these two are therefore classed as philosophical Grahas. Eighth Sloka in same Adhyaya is a further support\nof the same idea.\n\nGuru is a Graha who is supposed to represent Brahmin class, while Sani outcast or Chandala. A mutual\nParivartana – interchange, aspect or conjunction between these two Grahas will mean establishment of a cordial\nrelation between Brahmin and outcast. This is a very necessary qualification for a true philosopher. In this\nconnection, it will be apt to quote following Sloka:\n\nViewing from another aspect, Guru is a Graha representing happiness, while Sani represents misery – II-5, 7.\nGuru denotes holy places, while Sani stands for filth etc. A cordial relation between two will naturally prove\nexistence of an impartial viewing of all things in native.\n\nAgain, Guru is supposed to be Amaraguru or preceptor of Gods, and so can be understood to represent\nNarayana, that is Vishnu. In every Siva temple in India, idol of Sani – Saniswara is inevitable. Therefore, it will\nnot be mistake if one were to conclude that Sani represents Hara. It is a well known statement in Hindu\nPhilosophy that Hara, last of Hindu Trinity, stands for Destruction, while Hari, middle one, is for Protection. A\nmutual relationship between two Grahas in a nativity will now mean that native has got capacity to understand",

Assuming that Lord of Bhava under consideration is n\nRasis away from Bhava, Pada of Bhava falls in Rasi which is n Rasis removed from said Lord. This means Pada\nfalls in a Rasi whish is n + (n - 1) or 2n - 1 Rasis removed from Bhava.

In\nboth cases, Lords of respective Lagna are posited in Kendra positions and give their full aspect to Lagna.\nMangala in Makara for Mesha Lagna is a draw - so far as longevity of person is concerned. Though Mangala in\nthis position occupies one of best Kendras and is therefore with full Digbala, his Lordship over 8th will also\nhave to be considered. Mangala in Makara will naturally mean his full aspect over Lagna and cases where\nMangala and Sani are devoid of benefic aspect, this aspect will mean a very strong Alpayuryoga - vide III-8,\nRule 1 supra.",
