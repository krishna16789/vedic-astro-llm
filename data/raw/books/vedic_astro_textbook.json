Even if another book is needed, there are many\nerudite scholars who are better equipped than me to write. Nevertheless, I wanted,\nlike a parrot that enthusiastically repeats the few words learnt by it, to share with\nfellow students the little knowledge I received from classics and from my gurus.\n\nIn this book, I covered divisional charts, special ascendants, arudhas, argalas, yogas,\nashtakavarga, avasthas, a few nakshatra dasas, a few rasi dasas, several techniques\nof transit analysis, Tajaka analysis and a few miscellaneous topics.\n\nI tried to give prominence to special ascendants, divisional charts and arudhas,\nbecause contemporary literature doesn't seem to give them the kind of importance\nthat Sage Parasara gave.

    "output": "Unfortunately, some people think today that Parasara and Jaimini taught two totally\ndifferent approaches to astrology. When we talk about arudha padas, argalas, chara\nkarakas, chara dasa and other rasi dasas, people think of them as “Jaimini astrology”.\nPeople even use terms like “Jaimini karakas” and “Jaimini dasas”. However, all\nthese concepts were covered by Parasara also (please read “Brihat Parasara Hora\nSastram”). The “Parasari vs Jaimini” distinction is based on unfortunate\nmisconceptions that we can do away with.\n\nIn this book, I have de-emphasized these wrong distinctions and emphasized an\nintegrated approach – a holistic approach – that looks at Vedic astrology as a whole.\nI really think that this is the right approach.\n\nIn the part on dasas, I covered Vimsottari dasa and Ashtottari dasa, as they are the\nmost commonly used nakshatra dasas. Kalachakra dasa was termed the “most\nrespectable dasa” by Parasara and a discussion on dasas cannot be complete without\nit. In the galaxy of dasas, rasi dasas taught by Parasara and Jaimini have their own\nplace and I covered two rasi dasas used for timing material success – Lagna\nKendradi Rasi dasa and Sudasa. I also covered Narayana dasa, which is the most\nversatile rasi dasa taught by maharshis. For the spiritually inclined, I included\nDrigdasa, which can help us in timing events in one’s spiritual evolution. Because of\nthe importance of the topic of longevity, I covered two ayur dasas – Shoola dasa and\nNiryaana Shoola Dasa.\n\nIn the part on transits, I covered the interpretation of transits based on the natal\npositions of planets in rasi chart and divisional charts. I covered some techniques\nbased on ashtakavarga and sodhya pindas. I also covered several techniques related\nto transits in nakshatras.",

Some scholars may validly question why Tajaka system is being\ncovered in a book on Vedic astrology. There are no references to it in the works of\nParasara, Jaimini and other maharshis. The oldest reference to these techniques to be\nfound in the works of a respected authority on Vedic astrology is in “Tajaka\nNeelakanthi”, a work by Neelakantha who also wrote a celebrated commentary on\n“Jaimini Sutras”. His coverage of Tajaka system lends some authenticity to the\nsystem. One can only speculate whether Parasara talked about this system in parts\nthat are possibly missing today. I simply followed the precedent set by illustrious\nscholars of Vedic astrology, like Neelakantha and Dr. B.V. Raman.\n\nWhen we rely on finer techniques of Vedic astrology – such as divisional charts and\nspecial lagnas – for finer predictions, it is crucial to have an accurate birthtime. The\nchapter “Impact of Birthtime Error” shows how to cope with birthtime inaccuracies.\n\nWhile I am upset with the dismissal of astrology by some critics as a ‘superstition’, I\nam equally, if not more, upset with the irrational and unscientific attitude of some\nastrologers. In an effort to promote rational thinking in the astrological community, I\nincluded a chapter on “Rational Thinking”.\n\nA very brief introduction to some special topics such as remedial measures, mundane\nastrology and muhurtas is provided in this book and it is hoped that interested\nreaders will pursue these topics further by referring to other textbooks.",

Ancient Sages laid down\nsome rules for the ethical behavior of a Vedic astrologer. I earnestly hope that all the\nreaders of this book will appreciate those rules. To that end, I added a chapter on\n“Ethical Behavior of a Jyotishi”.\n\nWhile no particular topic has been covered in great depth, most key fundamentals are\ncovered in this book. Most fundamental concepts and computations are clearly\ndefined with examples and their uses are briefly outlined. But I do not want to bill\nthis as a comprehensive introduction for beginners. There are parts of this book that\ncan be followed even by beginners, but an average beginner may find it\noverwhelming in many places. For most part, this book is for intermediate level\nstudents who already have a good background, but are in need of integrating and\nconsolidating their knowledge. However, there are some points in some places that\ncan be appreciated only by advanced scholars. So I will not make any claims on who\nwill find this book useful. Rather than targeting readership with a specific level of\nknowledge, I tried to write a more or less self-sufficient book that covers a wide\nspectrum of topics. Beginners should read this book very carefully, and more than\nonce, to completely understand various concepts. Though I have tried to maintain\nsome level of clarity, I squeezed in a lot of material and beginners should patiently\nread, re-read and practice.\n\nDue to my background in engineering, I tried to adopt a style somewhat similar to\nthe one used in mathematics and physics textbooks. I tried to be concise and always\nto the point. I gave plenty of examples and even some exercises. I hope that students\nwill read the material and examples carefully and attempt the exercises sincerely. I\nhope that the astrological community will accept this new style of astrology teaching.",

However,\nbear in mind that extra reading can only do good!\n\nPlanets are constantly in motion with respect to earth in the skies. The positions of\nSun, Moon and some planets close to earth can give important clues about the\nfortunes of individual human beings and groups of human beings. That is the basic\npremise of astrology. How exactly we can make guesses about the fortunes of\nindividual human beings and groups of human beings based on the positions of those\nplanets in the skies is the question that we will attempt to answer in this book. While\nastrology is the subject that deals with this question, there are many theories and\nphilosophies in vogue and they are significantly different from each other.\n\nSunsign astrology, for example, is based on categorizing people into 12 groups based\non the solar month of birth. Some people may be convinced, based on their\nexperiences, that people born in the same month share certain qualities. It is,\nhowever, not very logical from a rational perspective – there are just too many\npeople in this world, who are totally different from each other. So the month of one's\nbirth is totally inadequate for guessing one's nature or fortune. Even the date and the\nhour of birth are not enough. We know that there are many twins in this world, who\nare significantly different from each other!",

It is a known fact\nthat there are many twins in this world, who are significantly different from each\nother and who lead totally different lives. Of course, some twins may have some\ncommon qualities between them, but the fact remains that several twins are\nsignificantly different. An astrological doctrine should be capable of explaining this\nfact in order to be considered as a meaningful subject.\n\nMost astrological doctrines of the world fail this acid test. If an astrological doctrine\nassumes, like in the case of many popular astrological theories of the world, that two\npersons born within a couple of hours in nearby towns will have the same fortune,\n\nthen that doctrine is obviously lacking in completeness and inadequate for confident\nuse in real-life. It fails the acid test of twins.\n\nMaterialistically speaking, India may not be a rich country today, but India has\nextremely rich cultural heritage. The depth of some of India's ancient knowledge\n(like astrology) is just amazing and it makes one wonder if the history of this great\ncivilization is correctly represented in the pages of modern history. Astrology of\nIndia is the most comprehensive and complete system of astrology available today\nand it is the only one that comes close to answering the just mentioned “twins\npuzzle”. India's astrology can explain how twins can be different. The principles\nused in India's astrology are so sensitive to changes in birthtime that people born\nwithin 1-2 minutes can be significantly different in some aspects and similar in some\nothers. This approach distinguishes between what a person truly is, what a person\nwants to be, what he thinks he is and what the world thinks he is.

This word was later\ncoined by the western invaders from the name of a river flowing on the northwestern\nborder of India (river “Sindhu” or “Indus”).

    "output": "Later day authors came up with the name – “Vedic astrology\". The word “Vedic”\nmeans “pertaining to Vedas\". Vedas are the sacred scriptures of, what is known\ntoday as, Hinduism and they are supposed to contain knowledge of all subjects.\nMoreover, astrology in particular is supposed to be a “Vedaanga” (which means a\nlimb of Vedas). In particular, it is said to be the eye of the Vedas. So the name\n“Vedic astrology” is becoming popular these days. This author also suggests using\n“Vedic astrology” or “Jyotish” (meaning “science of light\"). Jyotishi is a practitioner\nof Jyotish, i.e. a Vedic astrologer.\n\nThe words “planet” and “star” are used in a slightly different sense in astrology than\nin astronomy. For example, Sun (a star) and Moon (a satellite of earth) are called\nplanets in astrology, along with Mars etc. Basically, a graha or a planet is a body that\nhas considerable influence on the living beings on earth. Distant stars have negligible\ninfluence on us, but Sun, Moon and planets in the solar system have a great influence\non our activities. So the word graha (or planet) is used to describe them.\n\nSeven planets are considered in Indian astrology. They are – Sun, Moon, Mars,\nMercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. In addition, two “chaayaa grahas” (shadow\nplanets) are considered in Indian astrology – Rahu and Ketu. These are also called\n“the north node” and “the south node” respectively (or the head and tail of dragon).\nRahu and Ketu are not real planets; they are just some mathematical points.\n\nApart from these 9 planets, there are 11 moving mathematical points known as\nUpagrahas (sub-planets or satellites). We also have lagna (ascendant), which is the\npoint that rises on the eastern horizon as the earth rotates around itself. In addition,\nwe have some mathematical points known as “special ascendants\".",

These positions are measured as seen from earth and they are\ncalled “geocentric positions\". For the positions (calculated in degrees, minutes and\nseconds) of planets, lagna, special lagnas and upagrahas, we also use the words\nlongitude and sphuta. When watched from earth, the longitude of any planet in the\nskies can be from 0°0'0'' (0 degrees 0 minutes 0 seconds) to 359°59'59''. It should be\nnoted that 0°0'0'' corresponds to the beginning of the zodiac. Many western\nastrologers consider Sayana or tropical (moving) zodiac, whereas Nirayana or\nsidereal (fixed) zodiac is considered in Vedic astrology.\n\nThe zodiac (sky) lasts 360° as mentioned above and it is divided into 12 equal parts.\nThey are called “rasis” (signs). English names, Sanskrit names, two-letter symbols\nand values of the start longitude and the end longitude (in degrees, minutes and\nseconds) of all twelve rasis are given in Table 1.\n\nNotation: If a planet is at 221°37', then you can find from Table 1 that it is between\n210°0'0'' and 239°59'59''. So, that planet is in Scorpio (or Vrischika). Its\nadvancement from the start of the rasi occupied by is 11°37'.

Some people\n\nshow it as 7s 11° 37'. This means “after completing 7 signs, advanced by 11°37' in\nthe 8th sign (which is Scorpio)\".\n\nExercise 1:\nJupiter is at 94°19'. Mercury is at 5s 17° 45'.

In each chart, houses\ncan be found with respect to several reference points and the reference points most\ncommonly employed are lagna and special lagnas. Starting from the rasi occupied by\nthe selected reference point and proceeding in the regular order across the zodiac, we\nassociate each rasi with a house (first, second etc). Always the rasi containing the\nreference point chosen is the 1st house. Next rasi is the 2nd house. The rasi after that\nis the 3rd house. We proceed until the 12th house like that. Just remember that when\nwe encounter Pisces, we go to Aries after it. If no reference point is specified when\nhouses are mentioned, it means that lagna is used as the reference.\n\nIf, for example, horalagna is in Cn, first house with respect to horalagna is in Cn.\nSecond house is in Le (see Table 1). Third house is in Vi. Ninth house is in Pi. Tenth\nhouse is in Ar. Eleventh house is in Ta. Twelfth house is in Ge.\n\n(1) Lagna is in Cn, Sun is in Ar, Moon is in Ta and Mars is in Cp.

Based on the longitude of a planet, we can find the rasi occupied by it\nand mark its position in rasi chart.\n\nIn addition, we have what are known as “divisional charts” (Sanskrit name: varga\nchakras). These are based on dividing rasis into 2 parts, 3 parts, 4 parts and so on.\nWe divide each rasi into n parts and map each part to a rasi again. Based on the rasis\noccupied by planets in these divisional mappings, we draw divisional charts (or\nharmonic charts). Each divisional chart throws light on a specific area of one’s life.\nIn each divisional chart, we find houses and analyze the chart as if it were an\nindependent chart. The science of Vedic astrology stands on the basis of 4 pillars –\n(1) grahas or planets, (2) rasis or signs, (3) bhavas or houses, and, (4) varga chakras\nor divisional charts.\n\nIn Vedic astrology, the zodiac is divided into 27 nakshatras. Each nakshatra has a\nlength of 360º/27 = 13º 20'. The first nakshatra, for example, stretches from the\nbeginning of Aries to 13º 20' in Aries. The second nakshatra stretches from there to\n26º 40' in Aries. The third nakshatra stretches from there to 10º in Taurus. The list of\nnakshatras with the respective starting and ending points is given in Table 2. The\ntable also gives the “Vimsottari lords” of all nakshatras. This will be used later.\n\nEach nakshatra is again divided into 4 quarters. They are called padas (legs/feet).\nThe length of a nakshatra pada is 3º 20'.\n\nFor the purpose of some special charts like Kota Chakra and Sarvatobhadra Chakra,\nwe consider 28 nakshatras.

We write the classification of\n fortnight (Sukla or Krishna) first and then write tithi name. “Sukla Saptami”\n stands for “Saptami” in the brighter fortnight (sukla paksha), i.e. the 7th tithi.\n “Krishna Saptami” stands for “Saptami” in the darker fortnight (krishna paksha),\n i.e. the 22nd tithi.\n\nExample 2:\nLet us say that Moon is at 24°12' in Gemini. This is (2 x 30°) + 24° 12' = 84° 12'\nfrom the beginning of the zodiac.\n\nLet us say that Sun is at 17°46' in Scorpio. This is (7 x 30°) + 17° 46' = 227° 46'\nfrom the beginning of the zodiac.\n\nMoon – Sun = 84° 12' – 227° 46' = –(143° 34'). It is negative because Sun is at a\nhigher longitude. We have to add 360° to it to make it positive. It becomes 216° 26'.\nSo this is the advancement of Moon with respect to Sun.\n\nConverting this to a decimal number, we get 216.43°. We have to divide it by 12°.\nWe find 216.43 ÷ 12 and the quotient is 18. So 18 tithis are over. Adding 1 to it, we\nget 19 and so the 19th tithi is running. Referring to Table 3, we see that this is\n“Chaturthi” tithi of Krishna paksha (darker fortnight). So it is “Krishna Chaturthi”.\n\nExercise 3: Moon is at 14°43' in Leo. Sun is at 28°13' in Capricorn. Find the running\ntithi.",

If Sun-Moon conjoin in Pisces,\nfor example, it starts Chaitra maasa. These names come from the constellation that\nMoon is most likely to occupy on the full Moon day. In the month that starts when\nSun and Moon conjoin in Pisces, Moon is likely to be in Chitra constellation (23°20'\n\n2 Two planets are said to be in “conjunction” if they are exactly at the same longitude.\nNOTE: However, we sometimes use this term approximately.

This results in Sun-Moon conjunction coming twice in the same rasi.\nFor example, Sun-Moon conjunction took place at 0°23' in Taurus on May 15, 1999\nat 5:35:32 pm (IST) and again at 28°29' in Taurus on June 14, 1999 at 12:33:27 am\n(IST). Sun-Moon conjunction in Taurus starts Jyeshtha maasa (maasa = month) as\nper Table 4. So 1999 had 2 Jyeshtha maasas. One is called “Nija” Jeshtha maasa and\nthe other is called “Adhika” Jyeshtha maasa. Nija means real and adhika means\nextra. An adhika maasa (extra month) comes once in every 3 years and that\nsynchronizes the lunar years with solar years.

To convert\nthese positions, we have to subtract the difference between the two zodiacs. This\ndifference varies with time.

An aggressive response to an offender is often thought to be raajasik.\nHowever, sattwa simply means “the state of being true”. Pleasing others with\nartificial goodness is not sattwa guna. Punishing a person for his mistakes is not\nnecessarily rajo guna. If there is some passion and impurity in one’s energetic\nresponse, then it shows rajo guna. But, if a warrior fights a sinning person with no\npassion or ego, it can still be a saattvic act. Lord Sri Rama and Sun are examples for\nthis.

Lord Rama, who was\nborn with his amsa, is a saattwik person despite killing Ravana and other demons.\n\nSattva guna simply means purity and truthfulness in one’s thoughts and action.

So, if Dhuma is at 11°36' from the start of Aquarius, Indrachapa\nwill be at 11°36' from the start of Leo.\n\nVyatipata is obtained by subtracting Dhuma from 360º. We see that 360º – 22°56' =\n337°4'. So Vyatipata is at 337°4', i.e. at 7°4' from the start of Pi. Since Parivesha is at\n180º from Vyatipata, he is at 7°4' in Vi.\n\nExercise 7: If Sun is at 13°19' from the start of Ta, find the positions of all the five\nupagrahas defined so far.\n\nSix upagrahas called Kaala, Mrityu, Arthaprahaara, Yamaghantaka, Gulika and\nMaandi are more difficult to compute.

If we prefer to choose methods that work in spite\n of deviation in birthtime by a few minutes, we are ignoring a key fact – there are\n many people in this world who are born a few minutes apart in nearby places and\n yet lead significantly different lives. Still some people hide from this fact and\n stick to methods that give the same results to everyone born in a 15-minute or\n one-hour or two-hour period, because they don't have to deal with the\n complicated issue of birthtime errors then! But that's not the right approach – we\n should give importance to finer techniques. After all, Sage Parasara must have\n written about all these fine techniques only because he thought they were useful.\n\n(3) Some people define sunrise as the time when the center of the visual disk\n representing Sun rises on the eastern horizon, i.e., the time when lagna and Sun\n are exactly at the same longitude. Some other people consider sunrise as the time\n when the upper tip of the visual disk representing Sun appears to be rising on\n the eastern horizon, i.e., the time when the first ray of Sun is seen. The latter\n approach is recommended.\n\nExercise 9:\nSuppose (just suppose) that a key event from the known past of the lady of Exercise\n8 makes us think that her GL has to be between 16°15' and 17°30' in Virgo. Correct\nthe given birthtime accordingly.\n\nUse of special lagnas will become clearer in future chapters. For now, it will suffice\nto say that hora lagna shows money and ghati lagna shows power.\n\nIn any chart, normal lagna shows self. Hora lagna shows self, from the point of view\nof money, wealth and prosperity. Ghati lagna shows self, from the point of view of\nfame, power and authority. For example, when we time good and bad periods for a\nbusinessman, hora lagna may be very important. When we time good and bad\nperiods for a politician, ghati lagna may be very important.",

Computation of Sree Lagna will be explained for now.\n\n(2) Find the fraction of the constellation traversed by Moon.\n\n(4) Add this amount to the longitude of lagna. Subtract multiples of 360° if\n necessary. The resulting amount is the longitude of Sree Lagna (SL).\n\nExample 10:\nLet us take a native with Moon at 13 Li 06 and lagna at 25 Vi 05. Moon’s longitude\nis 180° + 13°6' = 193°6'. Lagna’s longitude 150°+25°5' is 175°5'.\n\n(1) Moon is in Swathi constellation, which runs from 6°40' to 20°0' in Libra.\n\n(2) Moon’s advancement in his constellation is 13°6' – 6°40' = 6°26'. As fraction of\n the whole constellation, this is (6°26')/(13°20') = 386'/800' = 0.4825.\n\n(3) The same fraction of the zodiac is 0.4825 x 360° = 173.7° = 173°42'.\n\n(4) Adding this amount to the longitude of lagna, we get 175°5' + 173°42' = 348°47.\n This is the longitude of SL.

Ar may be divided into 4 parts and the 4 parts may be mapped to Ar,\nCn, Li and Cp. Then the 4 parts of Ta may be mapped to Ta, Le, Sc and Aq. And so\non. Like this, we may divide all rasis into 4 parts and map the 4 parts to different\nrasis. We may also divide rasis to 9 parts and map each part into a rasi. We can have\nmany different divisions.\n\nSage Parasara defined 16 different divisions of rasis. Jaimini and Tajaka writers\nmentioned 4 more divisions. It is possible that Parasara also dealt with these 4\nspecial divisions in sections that are perhaps missing today. In addition, there are\nmore higher and finer divisions that are normally not used.\n\nBased on the rasis occupied by planets in various divisions, “divisional charts” are\ndrawn. As we have seen before, we need to know the rasis occupied by planets,\nupagrahas, lagna and special lagnas to draw any chart. In every division, we divide\nthe rasi into different parts, find the part containing each planet and see the rasi to\nwhich that part is mapped. Then we place the planet in that rasi in the chart\ncorresponding to that division. We can draw a chart for each division. A planet can\noccupy different rasis in different divisions.\n\nChart of each division is called a divisional chart. Each divisional chart can be\ntreated as a different chart and interpreted differently. Different aspects of life are\nseen in different divisional charts. Rasi chart is simply a special case of divisional\ncharts. If we divide each rasi into just one part (i.e. in effect, no division), we get rasi\nchart.\n\nIn the rest of this book, everything we describe will be applicable to all divisional\ncharts, unless we explicitly state a chart.

Suppose Moon is in Aquarius and suppose we want houses with respect to\nMoon. Then Aquarius is the 1st house, Pisces is the 2nd house, Aries is the 3rd house,\nTaurus is the 4th house and so on. As we go around the zodiac, we reach Capricorn\nwhen we find the 12th house.\n\nIn the same chart, Sun may be in Taurus. When we find houses with respect to Sun,\nTaurus contains the 1st house, Gemini contains the 2nd house, Cancer contains the 3rd\nhouse and so on. If Ghati Lagna is in Virgo in the same chart, then the 1st, 2nd and 3rd\nhouses with respect to Ghati Lagna are in Virgo, Libra and Scorpio respectively.\n\nThus we can find houses with respect to different references. The same sign may\ncontain the 2nd house with respect to one reference and the 6th house with respect to\nanother reference. If we mention houses without clearly specifying the reference\nused, it means that the reference used is lagna (ascendant).

All this complexity may be perplexing to new students. However, there is\nsomething we should realize. Human existence is a very complicated thing and it is\nsilly and unscientific to expect a simplistic model for the complicated human life.\nThough Vedic astrology has too many parameters used in chart analysis, they are all\nimportant as they give us the degrees of freedom necessary for modeling something\nas complicated as human life. However, if we do not understand what each\nparameter means and end up using them in a mixed-up way, we will get nowhere. So\nreaders should strive to understand these basics very clearly.\n\nLagna is the most commonly used reference when finding houses. If no reference is\nmentioned when houses are listed, it means that lagna – the default reference – was\nused. Lagna shows true self. If we are trying to understand someone’s status in\nsociety, lagna may not be the correct reference. Status does not relate to “true self”.\nIt is a part of the illusion of this world. However, if we are trying to understand\nsomeone’s intentions in doing something or someone’s knowledge or someone’s\npersistence, it relates to “true self”. So they are seen from the houses counted from\nlagna. Lagna shows true self. It shows the overall spirit of “I” (self).\n\nChandra lagna means Moon taken as a reference. We can find houses from Moon.\nBecause Moon is the significator of mind, these houses show things from the\nperspective of mind. For example, someone may be working in a routine job, but he\nmay have an active and enterprising mind and he may be using it in his career. In\nthat case, the 10th house (career) from lagna may have the influence of Saturn\n\n(routine job) and the 10th house from Moon may have the influence of Mars (active\nand enterprising).",

Because\nSun is the significator of soul, these houses show things from the perspective of soul.\nFor things related to physical vitality also, Sun is an important reference.\n\nComputation of arudha lagna (AL) will be explained in the chapter on “Arudha\nPadas”. For now, the readers should remember that arudha lagna shows how a native\nis perceived in the world. It also shows the status of a native.\n\nA planet in the 10th house from lagna may give some important developments in\none’s profession. A planet in the 10th house from Chandra lagna may give some\nimportant mental activity in one’s profession. A planet in the 10th house from arudha\nlagna may give some important developments in one’s professional status.\n\nPaaka lagna is important when analyzing the natal chart, dasas and transits. Paaka\nlagna is nothing but lagna lord taken as a reference. If someone with Pisces lagna has\nJupiter in Cancer, then Cancer becomes paaka lagna. If someone with Leo lagna has\nSun in Virgo, Virgo becomes paaka lagna.\n\nRasis represent situations and forces influencing the course of a native’s life and\nplanets represent individual beings. Lagna lord represents the physical self of a\nnative. So that is what paaka lagna shows. Houses counted from paaka lagna throw\nlight on matters related to the physical self of a native.",

Arudha padas are a very important concept of\nVedic astrology and they help us with that tough, but important, task.\n\nArudha padas of all the 12 houses (bhavas) in all the divisional charts are defined as\nfollows:\n\n(1) Take sign containing the house of interest in the divisional chart of interest.\n\n(2) Find the sign occupied by the lord of that house.\n\n NOTE: Aquarius is owned by Saturn and Rahu. Scorpio is owned\n by Mars and Ketu. Take the stronger lord in the case of houses\n falling in these two signs. The chapter on “Strength of Planets and\n Rasis” will explain the rules used in comparing the strengths of\n planets.",

Darapada or A7 shows one’s relationships. Upapada (UL)\nshows one’s marriage and spouse. A4 in D-16 shows one’s vehicle. A4 in D-24\nshows one’s school or college or university (place of education). A10 in D-10 shows\none’s workplace.\n\nArudha padas of planets show the perceptions of the native about the world, about\nhimself or herself and about the situations developing in his or her life.\n\nAnalysis of the positions of planets with respect to lagna shows reality. Analysis of\nthe positions of planets with respect to AL shows perceptions of the world and\nmaterial situation. Analysis of individual bhava arudhas throws light on various\nthings based on which world forms impressions about a native. Analysis of the\npositions of the arudha padas of planets with respect to lagna shows the perceptions\nof the native.\n\nExercise 12: AL in Aq, A2 in Ar, A3 in Sg, A4 in Sc, A5 in Sg, A6 in Aq, A7 in Pi,\nA8 in Vi, A9 in Ta, A10 in Sg, A11 in Sg, UL in Aq.",

A planet aspecting a\nhouse or a planet has some influence on the matters signified by that house or planet.\nThe nature of the influence exerted and the degree to which that influence succeeds\ndepends on the individual situation.\n\nThere are 2 kinds of aspects: (1) graha drishti and (2) rasi drishti. Drishti means\naspect. Each planet aspects certain houses from it with graha drishti (planetary\naspect). The houses aspected are fixed based on the planet. In addition, rasis aspect\neach other and a planet aspects the rasis aspected by the rasi occupied by it. This is\ncalled rasi drishti (sign aspect).\n\nAll planets aspect the 7th house from them. For example, Sun in Ta aspects Sc. Mars\nin Ge aspects Sg. Moon in Le aspects Aq. Jupiter in Pi aspects Vi. Saturn in Cp\naspects Cn. Find the 7th house from the planet and the planet aspects that house.\n\nIn addition, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn have special aspects:\n\n • Jupiter aspects the 5th and 9th houses from him, in addition to the 7th house.\n • Mars aspects the 4th and 8th houses from him, in addition to the 7th house.\n • Saturn aspects the 3rd and 10th houses from him, in addition to the 7th house.\n\nWe can decide the signs and houses aspected by a planet as above. If any planet\noccupies the aspected houses, then the planet is also aspected. For example, Jupiter\nin Ta will aspect Saturn in Cp, because Cp is the 9th house from Ta and Jupiter\naspects the 9th from him.",

It aspects all the fixed signs except the one\nadjacent to it, i.e. Ta. So Ar aspects Le, Sc and Aq.\n\nTa is a fixed sign. It aspects all the movable signs except the one adjacent to it, i.e.\nAr.

It also aspects the houses and planets in those signs. This aspect is called\n\nrasi drishti (sign aspect).

    "output": "A simple analogy will make things clearer. Look at planets as people. Let us take a\npriest as an example. Will he have some influence on his neighbors? Probably.\nBecause he lives there, gets up early in the morning and recites mantras, it may\ninfluence his neighbors also. Because of the houses they live in, his neighbors come\nunder his influence. How pious and god-fearing his influence makes his neighbors\ndepends on other factors. If one of the neighbors is a dreaded criminal, he is not\ngoing to be influenced.\n\nLet us take a dreaded criminal as another example. He may also have an influence on\nhis neighbors. Youngsters living in the neighboring houses may enter the criminal\nworld because of him. Ladies in the neighboring houses may stay inside their houses\nat night and not come out after certain time.\n\nThus we are influenced by people in neighboring houses. Influence exerted by\nplanets by rasi drishti is similar to this influence.\n\nCompared to this limited influence on the neighbors, a priest may have greater\ninfluence in the matters of the nearby temple where he works. He may have a lot of\ninfluence on devotees who come to visit the temple and who approach him for\nperforming poojas, homas etc. Influence exerted with graha drishti is similar to this\ninfluence.\n\nInfluence exerted by rasi drishti is due to the sign a planet is in. This is analogous to\nthe influence people exert on their neighbors. All planets in a sign will have rasi\ndrishti on the same signs, just as people living in the same house see the same\nneighbors everyday and exert some influence over the same neighbors. But the\ninfluence they exert may differ. A priest may tell his neighbors to pray to God. His\nmovie-loving brother living in the same house may talk the same neighbors into\n\nwatching all the movies of a particular actress. Thus, planets in the same sign exert\ninfluence on the same houses and planets through rasi drishti, but the nature of the\ninfluence varies from planet to planet.",

    "output": "Influence exerted by graha drishti is due to the inherent nature of a planet. Different\nplanets in the same sign may aspect different houses and planets with graha drishti.\nA priest may have great influence over the devotees at the temple he works at and his\nmovie-loving brother living in the same house may have great influence over his\nmovie-loving classmates and co-members of the fan club of an actress, of which he\nis president. Similarly, planets in the same sign may influence planets in different\nhouses. However, everyone in a house may have a strong influence over friends of\nthe family who visit the house frequently. Similarly, all planets aspect the 7th house\nfrom them and have an influence over it.\n\nIn addition to the influence caused by planets with graha drishti and rasi drishti, there\nis another influence called “argala”.\n\nArgala is a very important concept in Vedic astrology. Literally speaking, argala\nmeans “a bolt”. Argala on a house shows the influences that intervene in its affairs,\ndecide some parts of it and close the bolt on it, so to speak. Planet having rasi drishti\nhave a small influence. Planets having graha drishti have a more concrete influence.\nPlanets with argala simply decide some parts of the matter signified by the house.\nThe influence caused by argala is decisive.\n\nA planet or house in the 2nd, 4th and 11th houses from a planet or house causes\nprimary argala on the latter. Argala by a benefic planet is called a “subhaargala”\n(benefic intervention) and argala by a malefic planet is called a “paapaargala”\n(malefic intervention). This simple concept can be better appreciated if some\nexamples are given.",

If Jupiter is in\n5th house, he will give intelligence and his subhargala (benefic intervention) on 4th\nwill help one’s education. If Rahu is in 5th house, his papargala (malefic\n\nintervention) on 4th will cause obstacles in one’s education by way of poor\nintelligence. Similarly, benefics and malefics in the houses causing argala cause\ngood and bad intervention. Basically, the point is that intelligence, interaction and\nsamskara are the things that decide one’s education. They have a decisive role.\n\nLet us take another example. Short journeys are seen from the 3rd house. What are\nthe things necessary for a journey? One needs a vehicle (4th). One may need\nsomeone to serve one by driving the vehicle. Servants are seen from 6th. So, no\nwonder the 4th and 6th houses cause argala on the 3rd house, being the 2nd and 4th\nfrom it respectively! If one has papargala on 3rd from 4th, it may show trouble to the\njourney because of the vehicle. If one has papargala on 3rd from 6th, it may show\ntrouble to the journey because of the driver.\n\nLet us take another example.

Each of them can\nintervene in one’s domestic harmony. No wonder the 5th, 7th and 2nd houses have an\nargala on the 4th house (being the 2nd, 4th and 11th respectively from the 4th house)! If\na malefic in 5th has papargala on 4th, it may show domestic clashes and lack of sukha\n(comfort/happiness) on account of a child.

For example, let us say\nMercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are in Ge, Pi, Ar and Vi respectively. Saturn is in\nthe 4th from Mercury and Ge and he causes argala on them.

They make one the best in something.\n\nBasic Raaja Yoga: In any chart, Lord Vishnu sits in the quadrants and Goddess\nLakshmi sits in the trines. If the lord of a quadrant is associated with the lord of a\n\ntrine, that association brings the combined blessings of Lakshmi and Vishnu. This is\ncalled a Raaja Yoga. The native is powerful and prosperous.\n\nWhat do we mean by “association” here? There are 3 important associations:\n\n(1) The two planets are conjoined,\n(2) The two planets aspect each other with graha drishti, or,\n(3) The two planets have a parivartana (exchange). For example, if the 4th lord is in\n the 5th house and the 5th lord is in the 4th house, then we say that there is a\n parivartana between the 4th and 5th lords. This is an association.\n\nIf the lord of a quadrant and the lord of a trine have one of the three kinds of\nassociations mentioned above, it forms a Raaja Yoga. Lagna can be taken as a\nquadrant or a trine here. It is both.\n\nDharma-Karmadhipati Yoga: This is a special case of the above yoga. If the lords\nof dharma sthana (9th) and karma sthana (10th) form a raja yoga, it is known by this\nspecial name. The 9th house is the most important trine and the 10th house is the most\nimportant quadrant. Raja yoga involving the lords of these two houses is excellent.\nOne born with this yoga is sincere, devoted and righteous. He is fortunate and.\n\nVipareeta Raaja Yoga: The 6th, 8th and 12th houses are known as trik sthanas or\ndusthanas (bad houses). If their lords occupies dusthanas or conjoin dusthanas, it\nresults in this yoga. One having this yoga experiences tremedous success, typically\nafter an initial struggle. Vipareeta means extreme.\n\nBecause dusthanas show the obstacles one faces in life, situation of dusthana lords in\ndusthanas shows that obstacles will run into obstacles themselves.

But the results of this yoga may be experienced with just one or two dusthana\nlords occupying a dusthana.\n\nWe find the conjunction of the lords of a quadrant and a trine in many charts. The\nmagnitude to which this raaja yoga fructifies depends on the strength of the two\nplanets. The key factors that come into play are:\n\n(1) The two planets should be free from afflictions from functional malefics.\n\n(2) The conjunction or aspect responsible for the Raaja Yoga should be close (say,\n within 6° or so).\n\n If Mercury and Venus are at 2° and 26° in Ta for a native with Cp lagna, for\n example, their conjunction brings a Raaja Yoga (Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga in\n particular). However, the two planets are too far apart for this yoga to give its full\n results. They are still associated, but the association is not very strong. If Venus\n is at 3° in Ta in instead of 26°, the conjunction is very close and the yoga can\n give its full results, if other factors are favorable.\n\n(3) The two planets should not be combust, debilitated or in an inimical house or in\n bad avasthas (states).\n\nAny blemishes here will considerably reduce the magnitude of the yoga. In addition\nto the above factors, Sage Parasara recommended looking at the amsas occupied by\nthe 2 planets as per Dasa Varga (ten division) scheme. Count the divisional charts –\nout of the ten charts of Dasa Varga scheme – in which a planet occupies an own,\nexaltation or moolatrikona sign. Based on the count of divisional charts with such a\ngood placement for the planet in question, we say that it is in a particular amsa.\nPlease see the chapter “Divisional Charts” for details.\n\nIf the two planets giving raaja yoga have a count of one or zero, the yoga is ordinary\nand gives good results depending on the factors already outlined.",

Parasara said that the intellectual pygmies of Kali\nYuga cannot cope with too many complicated principles and presented ashtakavarga\nas a simple technique that lets them make reasonable predictions without much fuss.\nAshtaka means “consisting of eight” and varga means “a group”. Ashtakavarga is the\nsystem of analyzing a chart with respect to a group of 8 reference points.\n\nWhen we analyze the positions of planets with respect to lagna, we have the concept\nof good and bad placements. For example, Jupiter in the 9th from lagna will be well\nplaced and Jupiter in the 3rd will be badly placed. Mars in the 3rd from lagna will be\nwell placed and Mars in the 9th will be badly placed.\n\nHowever, lagna is not the only reference point in a chart. We have Sun and Moon. In\nfact, all the planets serve as reference points in a chart and they represent the sources\nof various energies that are present in a native. Based on the houses in which\ndifferent planets are placed in transit, they can be benefic with respect to some\nenergy sources and malefic with respect to some. If a transiting planet is benefic with\nrespect to more energy sources, then it brings good results.\n\nSo ashtakavarga is essentially a system that tells us the benefic positions of lagna and\nseven planets with respect to each other. This can be used to analyze the strength of a\nnatal chart, but it is much more important in analyzing transits.",

In other words, Mercury is benefic in Ar with\nrespect to 7 references. So we write 7 in Ar. We see that Mercury is benefic in Ta\nwith respect to Sun, Mercury, Venus and Saturn. In other words, Mercury is benefic\nin Ta with respect to 4 references. So we write 4 in Ta. We find the count of\nreferences for each rasi and prepare a chart.

Product for other rasis is zero,\nbecause they contain zero and we get zero by multiplying zero with any number. The\nsum of all the products is 21 + 10 + 24 + 22 = 77. So rasi pinda is 77.",

There are a few inconsistencies between the\nlists of benefic houses of Moon and Venus as given by Maharshi Parasara and the\ngreat astrologer Varahamihira, who is relatively modern, as he belongs to 600 AD.\nThese inconsistencies may have arisen due to corruption of texts in time46.",

He does\nthe same thing for all houses. So we can crosscheck. As if this isn’t enough, the Sage\nthen lists the references from which the planet is benefic. He does it in all the houses\nagain. Just as “checksum” values are transmitted in today’s digital communication\nschemes to provide resilience to transmission errors, the Sage, who normally uses\nwords sparingly, takes plenty of care to ensure that his teachings on ashtakavarga\nremain difficult to corrupt. To corrupt one house value in Parasara’s account of\nashtakavarga, one has to consciously re-write the verses in three different places in a\nconsistent fashion. With the direct approach adopted by other authors, one can\nchange the table just by changing one word. For example, changing “sukha”\n(comfort – 4th) to “suta” (son – 5th) changes one value without affecting the meter\nused in the verses. With Parasara’s indirect approach, consistent changes in multiple\nplaces are required for a single value change. So Parasara’s indirect approach is\nsuperior in corruption resistance. We will follow Parasara in this book.\n\nJust for the information of the reader, the places of conflict will be mentioned below:\n\n(1) Moon’s ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Moon is benefic in the 9th from Moon and\n malefic in the 9th from Mars.

We do not recognize the house\ndivision methods of Porphyry and others in this book. Each rasi is a house and the 1st\nhouse is the rasi containing the reference.

Count those\nhouses from the respective planets and find the rasis.\n\nUsing the above values, one can prepare a chart for each planet’s BAV, as shown in\nChart 11.\n\nUsing the above values, one can prepare a chart for SAV, as shown in Chart 11.\n\nLagna is in Vi in Chart 12. Vi it has 39 rekhas. That’s a lot more than 30! The 10th\nhouse (Ge) also has more than 30 rekhas.

Ghati lagna is\nin Taurus and its lord Venus occupies it. This makes ghati lagna and 9th house very\npowerful. This shows a fortunate (9th) and famous (GL) entertainer (Venus). Saturn’s\n11th house argala on GL suggests popular mass support as a catalyst in her success.\nRahu’s unobstructed 2nd house argala on lagna shows unconventional behavior in\npublic life.47\n\nFinal Answer: The chart belongs to Madonna, a pop diva of USA.",

Waxing Moon is a natural benefic and he becomes a functional malefic with\n\nquadrant ownership. Waning Moon, on the other hand, is a natural malefic and\nquadrant ownership makes him functionally neutral.\n\nA functional benefic is a favorable planet in a chart. Placement of a functional\nbenefic in quadrants (sustenance) and trines (prosperity) brings good results.\nPlacement of a functional malefic in these houses is not good, unless it is very\nstrong. A functional malefic placed in the 3rd house and dusthanas (6th, 8th and 12th\nhouses) brings good results, by spoiling the significations of the bad houses.\n\nIf a planet aspects or conjoins or owns HL and lagna, it becomes a yogada (giver of\nyoga) in money matters.

Its lord is called a\n“baadhaka” (troublemaker) for the original house. The list of baadhaka sthaanas and\nbaadhakas corresponding to each rasi is given in Table 31.\n\nFor example, suppose lagna in someone’s D-10 is in Ge. Then Jupiter is baadhaka\nfor lagna. The periods of Jupiter and planets in Sg can create some obstructions and\ntroubles in career. Let us take another house. Aq is the 9th house and the 9th house in\nD-10 shows the guidance one gets in one’s career. It can show manager and elders\ngiving guidance. Baadhaka sthana for Aq is Li. So the periods of Venus and\noccupants of Li can create some troubles related to the guidance one gets. There may\nbe some troubles related to manager. Thus we can consider baadhaka from every\nhouse and arudha pada in every divisional chart.\n\nWhen we analyze the charts, we should remember all the concepts we learnt in the\nprevious chapters. The following factors must be remembered:\n\n(1) Divisional Chart: Use the correct divisional chart for the matter of interest.\n Suppose we are looking at happiness from a vehicle. D-16 is the best chart.\n Suppose we are trying to analyze a criminal’s psychology. D-30 is the best chart.\n Suppose we are analyzing marriage. D-9 is the best chart. Suppose we are\n analyzing marriage in a culture where marriage is not a dharma (duty) and a\n union of souls, but it is merely living together of two people, then rasi chart may\n be better than D-9. Suppose we want to study one’s religious activities. Then D-\n 20 is the chart. If we want to study one’s learning, D-24 is the chart. Suppose we\n want to study one’s career and achievements in society, D-10 chart is the correct\n chart. In this manner, we should choose the correct divisional chart.",

Let us say that we are analyzing someone’s learning related activities and\n decided to look at D-24. If we want to see his education, we see the 4th house. If\n we want to see his intelligence, scholarship, academic reputation, academic\n distinctions/awards, students etc, we should look at the 5th house. If we want to\n see how one, in one’s pursuit of knowledge, interacts with others and what kind\n of people one interacts with, then we should see the 7th house. Like that, we\n choose the correct house for the matter of interest.\n\n(3) Reference: We should choose the correct reference for counting houses. In the\n above example of D-24, academic reputation is related more to the perceived self\n (AL) than the true self (lagna). So it is seen from the 5th from arudha lagna (AL).\n Intelligence and scholarship, on the other hand, are related to the true self and\n\n they are seen from the 5th from lagna. When the relevant karakas are stronger, we\n can use them as references instead of lagna. So scholarship can be seen from the\n 5th from Mercury. Students can be seen from the 5th lord. Intelligence can be seen\n from the 5th from Jupiter. Academic reputation can be seen in D-24 from the 5th\n from Sun.\n\n(4) House vs Arudha: Sometimes, an arudha pada is more appropriate to see a\n matter than a house. For example, we can see darapada (A7) in D-24 to figure out\n what kind of people one typically interacts with in one’s learning related\n activities. We can see one’s academic distinctions/awards in A5, because they are\n maya (illusion) related to intelligence and scholarship.

Planets\n influence it with rasi drishti and graha drishti. We should also check for argala.\n We should judge the meaning of each influence. We can also judge the\n influences on a house by finding houses with respect to that house. Planets in the\n quadrants from a house sustain it. Planets in trines from a house let it prosper.\n Planets in upachayas let it grow. Planets in dusthanas bring obstacles. Suppose\n we are analyzing A3 in an author’s D-10. While the 3rd house shows one’s\n writing skills, it is A3 that shows one’s books. If a planet is in a quadrant from\n A3, its periods may result in book writing. If a planet is in the 8th house from A3,\n its periods may bring obstacles in book writing. If a planet is a baadhaka from\n A3, it can create troubles in book-writing.\n\n(6) Standard Results: There are many standard results given in literature for various\n planets and house lords in various houses. These results should be mastered.\n\nAttention should be paid to the strength and avasthas of various planets and\nashtakavarga strength of various houses.

For spouse and his/her family members, we should\nsee D-9.\n\nIn each of these charts, we should look at the house that shows the person of interest\nand consider the rasi containing the lord of that house as lagna. We can consider the\ncorresponding arudha pada also. For example, the 9th lord or the arudha pada of 9th\nhouse in D-12 shows father.

Still, exalted Ketu’s aspect on Pi, the 5th house, gave him some skills in\nmathematics. But the debilitation of lagna lord and 5th lord makes him a mediocre\nstudent. From AL also, Mars in 7th, Venus in 6th, nodes in 12th are badly placed.\nMalefics in 3rd, 6th and 11th from AL and benefics in trines from it will give good\nresults.\n\nTo see one’s inherent nature, strengths and weaknesses, we should look at D-27. In\nSatyam’s D-27, lagna is in Ge and lagna lord Mercury aspects it. This gives Bhadra\nyoga like results. The 5th house of emotions and judgment is Libra and its lord Venus\noccupies it. This strength of lagna and 5th house made him a very jovial, amicable,\ncheerful and balanced person.",

In the\nrest of the book, we will see many more examples.\n\nMany human beings are curious about how long they will live. An ethical astrologer\nwill not scare a client by predicting death, but he may caution a client gently before\ncritical periods and suggest some remedial measures to ward off an impending\ndanger. An estimation of longevity is also helpful in matchmaking. After all, if one\nperson will live for 81 years and the other only for 36 years, it is not advisable to\napprove a match between those two people. In matchmaking, it is desirable that the\nbridegroom and the bride have comparable longevity.\n\nIn this chapter, we will study some basic tools that are used in longevity\ndetermination techniques. There are formulas for determining longevity, based on\nashtakavarga. But they do not always work and they will not be covered in this book.\nWe will cover the estimation of longevity based on natal chart and dasas.

Suppose lagna is in Le, Saturn is in Sg and\nMars is in Ge. Then Saturn is a maraka on account of owning the 7th house (Aq).\nMars is a malefic and he is in Ge. He aspects the 2nd house (Vi, with the 4th house\naspect) and the 7th lord (Saturn in Sg – with the 7th house aspect). Because of these\ntwo factors, Mars is a maraka. Let us take another example.

Each navamsa has a length of 3°20' (1/9th of 30°) and\n22°14' in Ge is in the 7th navamsa of Ge (please note that we are not talking about the rasi occupied by\nthe planet in navamsa). Then we use A = 7 for Mercury.\n52 Suppose sunrise was at 6 am and someone was born at 11 pm. So 17 hours were over. Each hour\nhas 2.5 ghatis and 17 hours = 17 x 2.5 = 42.5.

Because a ghati contains 24 minutes, this is 29.6 ghatis.\nSo the 30th ghati after sunrise was running at birth. So G = 30. Lagna is in Virgo, the\n\n6th rasi from Aries and so L = 6. The native’s given name starts with “V” and the\nnumber corresponding to this sound is 1.\n\nMercury: Mercury is at 3Ar08. He is in Aswini, i.e. 1st constellation.

These rules, however, are not applicable to all dasas.\n\nSun is in “Sabhaa” avastha and his strength is “Cheshta”. His results are “helps\nothers, possesses wealth, gems and lands, virtuous, very strong, affectionate and\nkind”. They are given in full.\n\nMars is in “Nidraa” avastha and his strength is “Drishti”. His results are “angry,\nunintelligent, poor, wicked, fallen from the virtuous path, sick” and they are given to\na medium degree.\n\nJupiter is in “Aagama” avastha and his strength is “Cheshta”. His results are “many\nconveyances, comforts, honors, servants, happiness from progeny, knowledge,\nfriends, learning and noble path” and they are given in full.\n\nRahu is alone and Saturn is alone. We have a tie after rule (1). Saturn is aspected by\nMercury and not aspected/conjoined by Jupiter and his dispositor (Jupiter again).\nRahu is aspected by Venus (his dispositor) and not aspected by Mercury and Jupiter.\nBoth have a count of one and we have a tie after rule (2). Neither Saturn nor Rahu is\n\nexalted after rule (3). Now we use rule (4). Saturn is in a dual rasi and Rahu is in a\nmovable rasi. So Saturn is stronger and he becomes the primary lord of Aq.",

Planets and rasis give\ntheir results in their respective periods and sub-periods. Each\ndasa system has a specific use. The nature of results given by\nplanets and rasis in their respective periods and sub-periods\ndepends on the dasa system being used.\n\n(1) Nakshatra dasas and Rasi dasas: Nakshatra dasas are\n based on Moon’s nakshatra (constellation). Rasi dasas are\n based on rasis occupied by planets and dasas are owned\n by rasis in rasi dasas.\n\n(2) Phalita dasas and Ayur dasas: Phalita means results and\n ayur means longevity. Phalita dasas are used for general\n results and ayur dasas are used for predicting death.\n\nHundreds of dasa systems were enumerated by the seers of\nVedic astrologey. Specific uses of these dasa systems weren’t\nclearly mentioned in classics. These are hidden in remote\ncorners of India as family secrets.",

    "output": "In this part, the use of the following dasa systems is explained\nin detail:\n\nSudarsana Chakra dasa is one of the most important dasas\nmentioned by Parasara. However, for reasons that will become\nclear later, we will learn it in the part “Tajaka Analysis”.\n\nVimsottari dasa is the most popular dasa system among Vedic astrologers of today.\nSage Parasara mentions in “Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram” that this dasa system is\nthe most suitable dasa system in Kali yuga.\n\nVimsottari means 120. Vimsottari dasa is a dasa system where the total duration of\nthe dasa cycle is 120 years. Dasas of different planets are for different number of\nyears, but the sum of all dasas is 120 years.\n\nIn Kali yuga, paramaayush (maximum longevity) of human beings is supposed to be\n120 years. Consequently, Vimsottari dasa is the most suitable dasa in Kali yuga.\n\nDasas are reckoned here based on the constellation occupied by Moon. There are\nother variations that are more applicable in some cases. Many contemporary Vedic\nastrologers ignore these variations and always reckon dasas from the lord of the\nconstellation occupied by Moon. However, this may not result in the best predictions\nalways. In this book, we will look at some of the variations.\n\nOne’s life is divided into dasas – periods – ruled by the nine planets. A dasa is also\ncalled a “mahadasa” (mahadasa = master period). Each mahadasa is again divided\ninto 9 sub-periods ruled by 9 planets. These sub-periods in mahadasas are called\n“antardasas”. We can divide further. Sub-periods in antardasas are called\n“pratyantardasas”. Sub-periods in pratyantardasas are called “sookshma-antardasas”\nor simply sookshma dasas. Sub-periods in sookshma dasas are called “prana-\nantardasas” or simply prana dasas. Sub-periods in prana dasas are called “deha-\nantardasas”. In this book, we will denote mahadasa with MD, antardasa with AD,\npratyantardasa with PD, sookshma dasa with SD, prana-antardasa with PAD and\ndeha-antardasa with DAD.",

At the end of the table, we come back to the first\nentry. For example, let us say that the first dasa is of Jupiter. Then the order of dasas\nwill be Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun (go back), Moon, Mars and Rahu.\n\nIn this manner, we can find the order of dasas and dasa lengths, given the first dasa.\n\nFor computing Vimsottari dasa, use the following steps:\n\n(2) Find the advancement of Moon in the constellation.\n\n(3) Find the part of the constellation that is yet to be traversed by Moon, as a fraction\n of the length of the constellation.

Only this\n amount in the first dasa is left at birth. The rest was over before birth.\n\nControversy: Dasa length of each planet was given in years in Table 38. For\nexample, Sun dasa is for 6 years. However, what is the meaning of “a year” here? Do\nwe mean the normal solar year, i.e. 365.2425 days?

Or, do we mean a period in which Moon traverses through\n360 constellations? Or, do we mean a period of 360 tithis (luni-solar days)? Most\nscholars, including this author’s guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, use solar years. However, this\nauthor prefers savana years based on the teachings of his father. Savana years will be\nused with nakshatra dasas in all the calculations given in this book. This is not meant\nto be a recommendation.",

The length yet to be traversed in\n this constellation as a fraction of the total constellation length = (13°20' –\n 9°3')/13°20' = 4°17'/13°20' = (4x60+17)/(13x60+20) = 257/800 = 0.32125.

Length of Mars antardasa is 7/120 of the total dasa length, i.e. 20x7/120\nyears = 1 year and 2 months. In this manner, we proportionally divide the period of a\nmahadasa into 9 antardasas.\n\nWe use the same procedure to divide each antardasa into 9 pratyantardasas, each\npratyantardasa into 9 sookshma dasas and so on.\n\nIn the case of the first dasa, we don’t divide the remainder at birth (2.24875 years of\nMars dasa remainder, for example, in Example 50) into 9 antardasas.

Saturn is an exalted\nyogakaraka from Moon and his antardasa should bring gains again.\n\nWe have so far seen examples of Vimsottari dasa used as a phalita dasa. We will\nnow see its use as an ayur dasa.\n\nExample 56: We will consider John F. Kennedy, Jr’s rasi chart (see Chart 21). He\npassed away on the night of July 16, 1999.\n\nParasara mentioned that the 3rd and 8th houses are the houses of life and the 2nd and\n7th houses are the houses of death. He said that the 2nd house is particularly a maraka\n(killer) house. Lords and occupants of these houses can kill a native.\n\nHere the 2nd house is Virgo. Its lord Mercury is in mrityu bhaga in the 3rd house. He\nis a strong maraka. Saturn is the 7th lord. He is also Maheswara, being the 8th lord\nfrom AK Mars. He joins Jupiter, who is Rudra. Saturn is also a strong maraka. Mr.\nKennedy was running Saturn-Mercury antardasa when he passed away.\n\nExample 57: Let us consider the rasi chart of a lady who committed suicide on April\n6, 1988 (see Chart 22).\n\nJupiter is the 7th lord here and he is exalted. He is a very strong maraka. Venus is 2nd\nlord in 2nd and he can kill too.\n\nMoon is in the 1st quarter of Bharani constellation. The 4th constellation is Mrigasira.\nBecause the 1st quarter of Mrigasira is in Taurus, we should take Taurus as the sign\nof 4th star. The 8th star is Aasresha in Cancer. Cancer contains 7th lord Jupiter, a\nmaraka. However, it is not aspected by 2nd lord. Taurus, on the other hand, has the\nrasi aspect of both Jupiter and Venus. Aspect of marakas makes a sign stronger. So\nstart dasas from the 4th star.\n\nFirst dasa belongs to Mars and Jupiter-Venus antardasa was running at death. Both\nthe planets are marakas.",

Venus is a maraka being in the 7th house, but he is not a very strong\n\nmaraka. Though Sun owns 7th, he is in 6th, i.e. in the 12th from 7th and the 11th from\n8th. The likelihood of Sun killing the native is small.\n\nWho are the strongest marakas in this chart? Certainly, Mercury is the strongest\nmaraka. He owns 8th and occupies 7th. Malefics in the 2nd house are strong marakas.\nSo Rahu in the 2nd is also a maraka. Mars is also a maraka, being the 3rd lord in 7th.\n\nLet us consider the variations of Vimsottari dasa based on 4th and 8th stars. The 4th\nstar is Pushyami in Cancer. The 8th star is Uttaraphalguni and its 1st quarter is in Leo.\nBecause Leo is the strongest sign, we can start dasas from Sun who owns\nUttaraphalguni (8th star from Moon’s star).\n\nStarting Vimsottari dasa from the 8th star, we can see that Mercury-Rahu antardasa\nwas running in December 1998. Killership of both the planets has already been\naddressed.\n\nIn this chapter, Vimsottari dasa and its variations are explained and their use is\ndemonstrated. Use of Vimsottari dasa as a phalita dasa as well as an ayur dasa is\ndemonstrated. As this is the most common constellation-based dasa system, readers\nshould master its use through practical experience.\n\nThough many people limit themselves to Vimsottari dasa started from the birthstar,\none is advised to use the variations mentioned in this chapter for the best results.\n\nIf all the quadrants from the stronger of lagna and Moon are occupied by planets,\n“Kendradi Graha Dasa” is more appropriate than Vimsottari dasa.

So an error of 5 minutes\nin the birthtime results in an error of 5x20/4 = 25 days in dasas (this is approximate).\nConsidering this, we cannot use low level sub-periods of Vimsottari dasa (like\nsookshma dasas) confidently, unless we rectify the birthtime.\n\nIt is a good idea to allow a margin of error when we examine the dates on which\ndasas start and end.\n\nAshtottari dasa is perhaps the most popular dasa system in India after Vimsottari\ndasa. Sage Parasara listed it as a conditional dasa applicable only in some charts. The\nconditions for its applicability are highly controversial.\n\nIn this system, the sum of all dasas is 108 years. Ashtottari means “ashtottara sata”,\ni.e. one hundred and eight. Because poornaayush (full life) of a man is 108 years,\nsome scholars have suggested that ashtottari dasa is best used as an ayur dasa, i.e. a\ndasa that shows longevity.\n\nSome other scholars suggest that Ashtottari dasa can be used as a phalita dasa.\nBecause only chara karakas, i.e. Rahu and the seven planets, have dasas under the\nAshtottari dasa scheme, it may also be suggested that it shows events related to\nsustenance, achievements, raja yogas and moksha (just like chara karakas do). Some\npeople, however, prefer to see all matters in Ashtottari dasa.\n\nOrder of dasas and the length of dasas is as shown in Table 39. Each planet covers an\narc of either 53°20' (4 nakshatras) or 40°0' (3 nakshatras) in the zodiac, as shown in\nthat table.",

The fraction of the arc that is yet to be\ntraversed by natal Moon is calculated and the same fraction of the dasa length of the\nfirst dasa lord is left at birth. After that, dasas will come in the order shown in the\ntable and the length of a planet’s dasa is the full dasa length given in the table. After\nVenus, we come back to Sun at the beginning of the table.\n\nExample 59: Suppose Moon is at 24° in Leo. That is equivalent to 24°0' + 120°0' =\n144°0'. We see that 144° is between 120°0' and 160°0'. So it is in the 2nd arc of Table\n39, which is ruled by Moon. The full dasa length is 15 years. Here we have to find\nthe fraction of the arc that is yet to be traversed. The arc starts at 120°0' and ends at\n160°0'. So the part of the arc that is yet to be traversed by Moon is (160°0' – 144°0')\n\n= 16°. As a fraction of the arc length (40°), this is 16°/40° = 0.4. The same fraction\nof the full dasa length of Moon is 15 x 0.4 = 6 years. The native will run Moon dasa\nof 6 years from his birth. Then 8 years of Mars dasa will run. Then 17 years of\nMercury dasa will run. Then 10 years of Saturn dasa will run. And so on.\n\nNOTE: One has to be careful with the calculation if the first dasa is Rahu dasa. The\narc ruled by Rahu starts at 333°20' and ends at 26°40'. The ending longitude 26°40' is\nequivalent to 386°40' and we should use either 26°40' or 386°40' based on Moon’s\nlongitude. For example, if Moon is at 10º in Aries, then the part of the arc that is yet\nto be traversed is 26°40' – 10° = 16°40'. If Moon is at 20º in Pisces, i.e. at 350º, then\nthe part of the arc that is yet to be traversed is 386°40' – 350° = 36°40'.",

Narayana dasa is computed differently for different divisional charts and we\ncan use Narayana dasa of a divisional chart to predict matters related to that\ndivisional chart.\n\nNarayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one’s life. As one dasa ends\nand another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and another rasi\nbecomes one’s progressed lagna. Using the progressed lagna as the reference, we\nfind out the events that happen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each\nperson, with each chart applicable in one dasa.\n\nThis is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould pay attention to the details of\ncalculation.\n\nDasas start from lagna or the 7th house, whichever is stronger.

If a\ndasa is of n years, then each antardasa in that dasa is for n months.\n\nAntardasas start from the rasi containing the lord of dasa rasi or the rasi containing\nthe lord of the 7th house from dasa rasi. Let us denote the stronger of dasa rasi and\nthe 7th from it with the expression “antardasa seed”. Antardasas start from the rasi\ncontaining the lord of antardasa seed and we take the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc houses from\nthere. The direction of counting houses is forward or backward based on whether the\nrasi from which antardasas start is an odd rasi or even rasi. (NOTE: We are talking\nabout odd and even signs here and not about odd-footed and even-footed signs).\n\nExample 67: Suppose Cp dasa of 5 years is running. Lords of Cp and Cn are Saturn\nand Moon respectively. Suppose Saturn is in Le and Moon is in Ta. Antardasas start\nfrom either Le or Ta. If Cp is stronger than Cn (or Saturn is much stronger than\nMoon), then we start from Le. If Cn is stronger than Cp (or Moon is much stronger\nthan Saturn), then we start from Ta. Let us say Cn is stronger than Cp and Saturn is\nnot much stronger than Moon. Then antardasas start from Ta, which contains Moon.\nBecause Ta is an even sign, counting is backward. So antardasas go as — Ta, Ar, Pi,\nAq, Cp, Sg, Sc, Li, Vi, Le, Cn and Ge. Each antardasa is of 5 months.\n\nExceptions: If Saturn occupies antardasa seed rasi, antardasas go in the forward\ndirection. If Ketu occupies antardasa seed rasi, antardasa direction is reversed (from\nforward to backward or from backward to forward).

We measure the length of a period (or a sub-period) by\nthe angle of the arc traversed by Sun during that period (or sub-period). Two periods\nare said to be equal if and only if Sun moves by the same degrees, minutes and\n\nseconds during the two periods.

It can\nalso be a rasi that aspects the rasi that, in navamsa, contains the owner of the 8th\nhouse from dasa rasi. Suppose dasa rasi at death is Ta and Jupiter is in Le in\nnavamsa. Then the antardasas of the 6th, 7th, 8th and 12th houses from Ta (i.e. Li, Sc,\nSg and Ar) can bring death. Also the antardasas of Ar, Le, Li and Cp – rasis that\naspect Le, which contains Jupiter in navamsa – can bring death.

Niryaana Shoola\ndasa starts from the stronger of Ta and Sc. Sc is stronger as it has one planet. Sc is an\neven rasi and normally dasas should go as Sc, Li, Vi etc. However, Saturn occupies\nSc and the “Saturn exception” applies.

Niryaana Shoola dasa starts from the 8th house from one of them.\nNiryaana Shoola dasa essentially shows the progress of the 8th house. It shows the\nmotion of praana (life). That is why it has an uneven motion. It goes forward in some\ncharts and backward in some charts. Also the lengths of dasas can be 7, 8 or 9 years.\nAll this shows that different people have different motion of praana. When praana\nreaches Shiva’s Trishoola or a powerful maraka rasi, the native can die. In Shoola\ndasa, however, the motion has a constant rate of 9 years per dasa and the order of\ndasas is always fixed. This fixed motion is like the motion of a quartz crystal. It is\nnot the motion of praana and it must be a universal motion. It is suggested that\nShoola dasas show the force of Lord Shiva. The force of Lord Shiva starts from\none’s self and moves at a constant rate in a fixed direction. So Shoola dasa rasi\nhitting Trishoola rasis is less significant than Niryaana Shoola dasa rasi hitting\nTrishoola rasis. In the case of Shoola dasa, death occurs when Shiva’s motion hits\nAL or the trines from it or the houses of vitality from AL (3rd and 8th). AL is\ninvolved instead of lagna, because our existence is a maya (illusion) and what Lord\nShiva destroys is the illusion of our existence. The physical body (lagna) simply\nmerges with the material universe, when burnt or buried, and the perceived self or\nthe maya of existence (AL) is what is completely destroyed by Lord Shiva.\n\nLesson: Niryaana Shoola dasa shows the motion of praana (life). Death occurs when\npraana hits maraka rasis and the trines from Rudra (Trishoola rasis). Shoola dasa is\nthe reverse. It shows the motion of Shiva. Death occurs primarily when Shiva’s\nmotion hits the trines from AL or the 3rd house from AL or the 8th house from AL.",

Shoola dasa starts from the stronger of that rasi and the 7th from it.\nWe have different names for Shoola dasas started from different houses. For\nexample, Pitri Shoola dasa (pitri = father) starts from the stronger of 9th and 3rd\nhouses. It is used in the timing of father’s death. Bhratri Shoola dasa (bhratri =\nbrother) also starts from the stronger of 3rd and 9th houses and it shows the death of\nyounger siblings. Matri Shoola dasa (matri = mother) starts from the stronger of 4th\nand 10th houses. Dara Shoola dasa (dara = wife) starts from the stronger of 7th and 1st\nhouses and it shows the death of wife (this dasa will be identical to the native’s\nnormal Shoola dasa). Putra Shoola dasa (putra = son) starts from the stronger of 5th\nand 11th houses and it shows the death of a child.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that sthira karakas are useful in timing death. Sthira karaka of\nfather represents father in a chart, for the purpose of matters controlled by Shiva (i.e.\nsuffering and death). Pitri Shoola dasa shows the motion of Shiva’s force for the\nfather. When Shiva’s force strikes trines from sthira karaka of father, father’s death\ncan take place. Trines from the corresponding arudha pada can also give death.\n\nSimilarly, we can time the death of other near relatives. Let us see a couple of\nexamples.\n\nExample 93: Let us consider the native of Chart 44. His father passed away in the\nsecond half of 1995.\n\nExalted Sun joins Mercury and Jupiter aspects him.

Kalachakra literally means “the wheel of Time”. It\nshows how the wheel of time unfolds events in the life of an individual.

Savya means “zodiacal” and apasavya means\n“anti-zodiacal”.\n\nWe write the 12 rasis in one set (either zodiacally or anti-zodiacally).

However, the mirror image of Cn is Cn itself and that of Le is Le itself, as they\nare the only signs owned by their lords. The main sequence and the mirrored\nsequence together form a sequence of 24 rasis. We have two such sequences – one\nfor the savya group and the other for the apasavya group (see Table 43).

So Sc dasa was running at birth and 7 – 2.25 = 4.75 years of Sc dasa\nwere remaining at birth. By adding 4 years 9 months to the birthdate, we get the date\non which Sc dasa ends.

In the cases of dasas, the\nstarting point in the 24-rasi sequence is determined by the nakshatra pada of Moon\nand the portion elapsed in it. In the case of antardasas, the starting point is based on\ndasa rasi.\n\nTo learn how the lengths of antardasas are computed, let us take Le dasa as an\nexample. We found that antardasas in Le dasa are Le, Cn, Ge, Ta, Ar, Sg, Cp, Aq, Pi.\nBy adding the dasa lengths of these 9 rasis (see Table 48), we get 86 years.

So some of\nthese antardasas may be over before birth.\n\nDasa of a rasi gives the natural results of the rasi. For example, dasa of Pisces may\ngive saattwik religious activities. Dasa of Aries may give enterprise or quarrels or\nwounds.\n\nMore importantly, dasa of a rasi gives the results of the house and planets in that rasi.\nIf Aries has the 5th house in D-7, its dasa may give children. If Pisces has the 8th\nhouse in D-6, its dasa may give diseases. If Gemini has lagna in D-24, its dasa may\ngive all-round progress in the accumulation of knowledge.

If a rasi has too many or too few rekhas in SAV of a particular divisional chart,\nthen its dasa may bring favorable or unfavorable results, respectively, relating to the\nsignifications of that house in that divisional chart. Usually dasas of rasis with 30 or\nmore rekhas in D-10 SAV bring the best phases in one’s career and dasas of rasis\nwith 30 or more rekhas in in D-24 SAV bring the best periods for learning. One\nshould keep SAV of various divisional charts with one when interpreting Kalachakra\ndasa.\n\nIn Table 44-Table 47, we listed the deha and jeeva rasis of different nakshatra padas.\nHowever, these hold for one born at the beginning of the nakshatra pada. One can\nhave different deha and jeeva rasis based on the elapsed portion in the nakshatra\npada.\n\nDeha and jeeva rasis are simply the rasis of the first and the ninth dasas in the case\nof one born in a savya nakshatra. In the case of one born in an apasavya nakshatra,\ndeha and jeeva rasis are the rasis of the ninth and the first dasas.\n\nIn Example 95, the first dasa is Sc and the ninth dasa is Sg. Since Rohini is an\napasavya nakshatra, Sc becomes jeeva rasi and Sg becomes deha rasi. In Example\n96, the first dasa is Pi and the ninth dasa is Ar. Since Punarvasu is a savya nakshatra,\nPi becomes deha rasi and Ar becomes jeeva rasi.\n\nDeha rasi shows body and jeeva rasi shows the spirit. Benefics and malefics\ntransiting in them affect them positively and negatively (respectively). If Jupiter,\nMercury and Venus are transiting in one’s jeeva rasi, one may exhibit a positive\nspirit and be cheerful. If Mars, Sun, Saturn and Rahu are transiting in one’s jeeva\nrasi, one may be without any enthusiasm. If Mars, Sun, Saturn and Rahu are\ntransiting in one’s deha rasi, one may face accidents or death.",

So Le is a markati\n gati rasi. Similarly, when we go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Le, Cn, Vi, Li, Sc etc in apasavya\n nakshatras, we temporarily reverse the direction when we go from Le to Cn. So\n Cn is a markati gati rasi.\n\n(3) Leaving one rasi and jumping over it is called “Mandooki gati” (frog’s leap).\n When we go as Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar etc in savya nakshatras, we have 2\n jumps – (i) from Vi to Cn and (ii) Le to Ge.

So Le and Vi\n are mandooki gati rasis.\n\n67 Simhavalokana doesn’t really mean a lion. It strictly means a lion’s view of the jungle from an\nelevated vantage point.\n\nThe results attributed to various leaps are given in Table 51.\n\nIn addition, Parasara listed the directions to prefer and the directions avoid, while\ntravelling and relocating, during different leaps.\n\n(1) In the leap from Vi to Cn, east will give great results. One can take up an\n auspicious journey in the northern direction.\n\n(2) In the leap from Le to Ge, east should be avoided.

At the time of wedding, the native was\nrunning Pi-Pi (Pi dasa & Pi antardasa). Why did Pisces give marriage?\n\nWell, it has lagna in navamsa and its lord Jupiter is in the 7th house! Naturally Pi and\nVi are the front-runners for giving marriage. Moreover, Pi is the 2nd from Venus.\nVenus symbolizes domestic happiness and marital bliss. The 2nd from him in\nnavamsa can show the sense of family happiness. It can show a new person coming\ninto the family.\n\nIn addition, one may note that exalted Venus occupies Pi in rasi chart and he owns\ndarapada, which is in Libra. So Pisces is conducive to physical relationship and\nmarital pleasures.\n\nVenus is in Aq in navamsa. While rasi shows what exists at the physical level,\nnavamsa shows the inner self and the sense of connectedness. So Aq dasa can\nactivate Venusian influence at navamsa level and give some romance. During Aq\ndasa (1990-1994), this native had a love affair with the lady he was to marry in\nDecember 1994.\n\nExample 99: The D-24 shown in Chart 47 belongs to an astrologer. He learnt\nastrology at a young age, but he has been seriously into astrology since 1993. In\nparticular, 1996-2000 was a very fruitful period. Knowledge came to him like rain\nfrom monsoon clouds.

A significant percentage of this\nauthor’s successful long-range life-phase predictions were made using Kalachakra\ndasa68 and that is his favorite dasa.\n\n68 And, a significant percentage his successful short-term predictions (focussing on a period of one or\ntwo weeks) were made using Tajaka annual and monthly charts.\n\nWhen we learn a new dasa, the first question we should ask is “when should it be\napplied and what results should be seen in it”. It is illogical to use 10 different dasas\ninterchangably. Mixing up various dasas without knowing the subtle differences\nbetween them results in vague explanations. An intelligent astrologer will realize that\ndifferent dasas are good at showing different kinds of events.

It shows how\nconnected one is with respect to the events in one’s life. For example, a political\nleader may be running D-10 Narayana dasa of a yogakaraka rasi and he may land\npolitical power. He may be running the Vimsottari dasa of Sun who may be exalted\nin D-10 and so he may be feeling powerful.

These three are the most important of all general\npurpose phalita dasas.\n\nDifferent dasas do not provide different alternatives that can be used interchangeably\nto understand what happens in one’s life, but they provide different angles – or\nvantage points – to view the same kaleidoscope that life is.",

A planet occupying or\naspecting a rasi in transit influences the matters signified by the houses and\nplanets stationed in that rasi in the natal chart.

Houses from Moon show mind, wisdom,\npeace, happiness and mother. Houses from Mars show siblings, land and strength.\nHouses from Mercury stress on business, commerce, profession, friends and good\nbehavior. Houses from Jupiter show the nourishment of body, learning, children and\nwealth. Houses from Venus show marriage, comforts, luxuries, vehicles and sexual\npleasures. Saturn shows longevity, livelihood, fears, sadness, dangers and sorrows.\n\nWhen we want to time events relating to a particular matter, we should first fix the\nrelevant planet. Then we should fix the relevant house. We should then find the\nnumber of rekhas in that house from that planet in that planet’s BAV. We should\nmultiply it by the sodhya pinda of the planet (also called yoga pinda). By dividing\nthe product with 27 or 12 and taking the remainder, we should find the associated\n\nnakshatra or rasi. Then we can time key events based on the transits in that nakshatra\nand rasi.\n\nFor example, suppose we want to time the good and bad periods of a native’s father.\nFather should be seen from Sun and the 9th house. We can take Sun’s BAV and find\nthe number of rekhas in the 9th house from Sun. Suppose Sun is in Aq. Suppose\nSun’s BAV contains 5 rekhas in Li (the 9th from Aq). Suppose Sun’s sodhya pinda is\n86. Multiplying 86 with 5, we get 430. If we divide 430 by 27, the quotient is 15 and\nthe remainder is 25. The 25th constellation is Poorvabhadrapada. So Saturn’s transit\nin Poorvabhadrapada is bad for father and Jupiter’s transit in the same nakshatra is\ngood. Now let us find the rasi. By dividing 430 by 12, we get a quotient of 35 and a\nremainder of 10. So Saturn’s transit in Cp (the 10th rasi of the zodiac) is bad for\nfather and Jupiter’s transit in Cp is good.",

A\nlist of the matters is given in Table 61.\n\nSome examples will be given now. However, this approach does not give consistent\nresults. Readers should realize that the topic of sodhya pindas is open to research.\nMost astrologers use these principles with only the rasi chart. If matters relating to\nfather have to be seen from D-12, as taught by Parasara, should we use D-12 when\ntiming events related to father? Should we use the sodhya pinda and rekha count\nfrom D-12? Should we take the 9th from Sun in rasi chart or take it in D-12? All\nthese are issues that need to be researched. Moreover, as we have learnt, there are\nsome inconsistencies between Parasara and Varahamihira in the definition of\nashtakavarga and this can alter the sodhya pindas of Moon and Venus. In addition,\n\nwe have some controversies in the exact definitions of the reductions to be done to\nget Sodhita Ashtakavarga from Bhinna Ashtakavarga. That can again alter sodhya\npindas. Timing of events with sodhya pindas is a very important topic, but what the\nreaders learn here may not be the final word. It is hoped that readers will experiment\nwith an open mind and share their findings with other astrologers.\n\nExample 111: Let us consider Princess Diana, who died in a fatal automobile crash\nwhen Saturn was in Revathi star (Pisces). Her rasi chart is given in Chart 62.\n\nTo see longevity, we should use the 8th house from Saturn and Saturn’s BAV. The 8th\nhouse from Saturn is Le.\n\nLe has 0 rekhas in Saturn’s BAV. Saturn’s sodhya pinda is 203. The product is 0. By\ndividing it with 27, we get 0 which is equivalent to 27. So we get Revathi star. By\ndividing 0 with 12, we get 0 which is equivalent to 12.

Suppose\nsomeone has natal Moon in Pisces (e.g. Bill Gates, whose chart was considered\nearlier). Aquarius is the 12th house from Pisces. So Mercury is a loha murthi (iron\nform) during his Ge transit. That is highly unfavorable. Even if it is a favorable\ntransit otherwise, Mercury may not give his full results. If it is an unfavorable transit\notherwise, then Mercury will make the native suffer much.\n\nWe listed the good and bad houses for all planets to transit from natal Moon in a\nprevious chapter. Even when a planet is transiting in a favorable house from natal\nMoon, it may be “obstructed” by another planet transiting in the vedha sthana (house\nof obstruction). In that case, the planet cannot give its good results. The vedha\nsthaanas of all good transits of all planets are listed in Table 63.\n\nLet us take Bill Gates, who has natal Moon in Pisces. Natal lagna and arudha lagna\nlord Mercury transits in Gemini during June 2000. As Mercury transiting in the 4th\nhouse from natal Moon is auspicious, this transit should bring good results.

Sarvatobhadra chakra is a chart that shows all-round well-being and all\nkinds of auspicious and inauspicious results.\n\nThere are 9 x 9 = 81 squares in the chart. Middle 7 squares on the outer borders\ncontains 7 nakshatras each. Abhijit (the last quarter of Uttarashadha) is included\namong the nakshatras. The innermost 5 squares contains weekdays and tithis (lunar\ndays). The notation regarding tithis is:\n\n(1) The entry Nanda represents 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st and 26th tithis.\n(2) The entry Bhadra represents 2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd and 27th tithis.\n(3) The entry Jaya represents 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd and 28th tithis.\n(4) The entry Rikta represents 4th, 9th, 14th, 19th, 24th and 29th tithis.\n(5) The entry Poorna represents 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th and 30th tithis.\n\nRasis are also included in the chart. Some consonants are listed in the squres just\ninside the border squares. All the squares lying on diagonals of the chart, except the\ncentral square of the chart, contain vowels.

We can draw one vertical or horizontal line and\ntwo crossward lines starting at the nakshatra. Contents of the squares on the lines\nhave vedha from the planet.\n\nExample 114: Let us say Saturn is in Punarvasu. We see that Punarvasu is on the\neastern border.",

    "output": "Readers should refer to the first chapter for the procedure of finding tithis. Karma\ntithi is a little different from normal tithi. To find karma tithi, we multiply the\ndifference between Moon’s longitude and Sun’s longitude with 10 and reduce the\nproduct to a value between 0º and 360º (by adding or subtracting multiples of 360º).\nWe divide it by 12 and add 1 to the quotient. That gives a number between 1 and 30\nand that represents “karma tithi”. Karma tithi changes 10 times as fast as normal\ntithi. Similarly “dhana tithi” (lunar day of wealth) changes twice as fast as normal\ntithi. We can find a tithi for several matters. The tithi relevant to the matter of\ninterest should be used when finding vedha of transiting planets on tithis (Nanda,\nBhadra, Jaya, Rikta and Poorna).\n\nLet us take an example. If the 10th house, karma nakshatra, karma tithi and janma\nvaara all have the vedha of a couple of transiting benefics, then some good\ndevelopments may take place in the native’s career. If they have the vedha of a\ncouple of malefics (instead of benefics), then we can expect setbacks in the native’s\ncareer. In this manner, we study the impact of transits on important tithis, janma\nvaara, important nakshatras and important houses in natal chart. If just one natal\nreference has vedha from just one planet, we cannot make any predictions. But, if 2-\n3 natal reference have vedha from a couple of benefic/malefic transit planets, then\nwe can be more confident. However, a prediction should be made only if dasas and\nTajaka charts also show an event.\n\nExample 115: Let us consider the death of John F.

Of course, one will not die whenever this happens, but\nthis will increase the chances of death.\n\nIn the transit chart, Saturn is in naidhana nakshatra Bharani. Mars is in Swati. Rahu\nis in Asresha. Ketu is in Sravanam.\n\nIf we draw crossward lines from Ketu in Sravanam and Saturn in Bharani, we can\nsee that they intersect in the square containing Jaya and Thursday.

    "output": "A sub-system of Indian astrology, popularly known as “Tajaka\nsystem”, is extremely useful in making precise and pointed\npredictions. It considers planetary aspects and yogas different\nfrom those employed in other classical methods of Vedic\nastrology and it is closer to western astrology in terms of\naspects and yogas. In fact, some scholars may validly question\nwhy Tajaka system is being covered in a book on Vedic\nastrology. There are no references to it in the works of Parasara,\nJaimini and other maharshis. The oldest reference to these\ntechniques to be found in the works of a respected authority on\nVedic astrology is in “Tajaka Neelakanthi”, a work by\nNeelakantha who wrote a celebrated commentary on “Jaimini\nSutras”. His coverage of Tajaka system lends some authenticity\nto the system. One can only speculate whether Parasara talked\nabout this system in parts that are possibly missing today. We\nwill cover this system in this book, because some illustrious\nscholars of Vedic astrology, like Neelakantha and Dr. B.V.\nRaman, set the precedent by teaching this system.\n\nThis system is based on solar return charts. When Sun returns\nevery year to the position he occupied in the zodiac at the time\nof a person’s birth, a new year is said to commence for the\nperson and a chart drawn for that time is called “Tajaka annual\nchart” or “Tajaka varsha chakra”. Analysis of this chart can\ngive insights into what may be in store during the one year\nfollowing the solar return. Results suggested in the annual chart\ncan take place only if they are ‘possible’ based on natal chart\nalso. However, annual chart often gives a finer insight into the\nyear in question than natal chart.\n\nA few special dasa systems enable timing of events within the\n365-day period of operation of an annual chart.\n\nSimilar to the annual charts, “monthly solar return charts”\n(Tajaka masa chakras) can also be drawn and they are useful in\nanalyzing a one-month period in depth.",

At the exact moment when Sun\nreturns to the exact position he occupied at the time of a person’s birth, a new year\nis said to commence in the life of that person. A chart can be cast for the\ncommencement of the new year. This is called a Tajaka varsha chakra or a Tajaka\nannual chart75. The longitude and latitude of the birthplace must be used in casting\nthis chart, irrespective of the place of living at the commencement of the new year.\n\nThe commencement of a new year is called “varsha pravesh” by some people.\nVarsha means a year and pravesh means entry.\n\nLet us take a native with this birthdata: 8th March 1967, 5:40 pm (IST), 73 E 04, 26\nN 18.

This is called Tajaka maasa chakra or a Tajaka monthly chart.\n\nThe commencement of a new month is called “maasa pravesh” by some people.\n\nA year is the period in which Sun moves by 360º. A month is the period in which\nSun moves by 30º.\n\nLet us take the native of Example 118. He was born on 8th March 1967. Sun was at\n23° 50' 25'' in Aq when he was born. On 8th March 2000, Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in\nAq at 4:41:21 am (IST) and a new year commences then. This is the 34th year in the\nlife of the native.\n\nAlong with the new year, a new month commences then. This is the first month of\nthe year. This month ends and a new month commences after Sun moves by exactly\n30°. Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in Pi on 7th April 2000 at 10:38:06 am. The second month\nin the year commences then. We can cast rasi chart and divisional charts at that\nmoment. Using those charts, we can predict events in the next one-month period.\nThis month ends and the third month commences when Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in Ar.\n\nThus, when Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in different rasis, we cast different monthly charts\nand use them for predicting the events in a one-month period. The thing to remember\nhere is that “one month” is the time when Sun moves by exactly 30°.\n\nThere isn’t any good approximate method for casting monthly charts. Sun takes\napproximately the same time for moving by 360° and so we have an approximate\nmethod for annual charts. But the time Sun takes to move by 30° varies considerably\nfrom month to month. So there isn’t any approximate method that gives decent",

It may be wise to exactly cast 12 monthly charts for the first year of the\nnative and then find monthly charts in later years from them, using the approximate\nmethod given for annual charts.\n\nA month is again divided into 12 shashti-horas. Each shashti-hora period consists of\n60 hours, i.e. 2.5 days. At the beginning of every shashti-hora, a Tajaka shashti-hora\nchakra78 (Tajaka sixty-hour chart) is cast. In the period corresponding to each Tajaka\nsixty-hour chart, Sun moves by 2º30'.\n\nIn other words, we can cast a chart after every 2º30' motion of Sun and use that\nTajaka sixty-hour chart to predict events in the 2.5-day period commencing then.\nThere are exactly 12 such charts in a one-month period.\n\nFor example, let us take the second month of the year 2000-2001 for the native of\nExample 118. The second month commences when Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in Pi, i.e.\non 7th April 2000 at 10:38:06 am. The first shashti-hora of the month also starts then.\nIt ends and the second shashti-hora or 60-hour period commences when Sun is\nadvanced by 2º30', i.e. when Sun enters 26° 20' 25'' in Pi. This happens at 11:40:51\npm (IST) on 9th April 2000. If we cast a chart for that moment, we can make some\npredictions for the next 2.5 days.\n\nIn this chapter, we learnt what Tajaka annual and monthly charts are and how they\nare cast. When Sun re-enters every year the same longitude occupied by him at the\ntime of one’s birth, it signals the commencement of a new year in the native’s life.\nWe can cast a chart for that exact moment and predict events in the next one year\nbased on that chart. We can also cast monthly charts and sixty-hour charts.\n\nThese new years are based on the solar years and the commencement of new year is\naround one’s birthday as per the modern western calendar.

Lunar calendar is of great importance in Indian culture. Correspondingly,\nthere are techniques based on the birthday as per lunar calendar. However, those\ntechniques are beyond the scope of this book and we will restrict ourselves to solar\nbirthday and Tajaka annual charts.\n\n(1) The approximate birthday of the 27th year is 8th March 1993. He completes 26\n years then.\n(2) Adding the entries of 20 years and 6 years, we get 4 days 15 hr 58 min 12 sec.\n(3) Adding 4 days to Wednesday (weekday of birth), we get Sunday.

    "output": "Muntha is very important in Tajaka charts. Muntha is as important a reference point\nin an annual chart as lagna. The reason may be obvious in the chapter on “Sudarsana\nChakra Dasa”. Some people find muntha in monthly charts by progressing natal\nlagna by 2º30' per month. This author takes a different stand and the readers may be\nable to appreciate this after reading the same chapter.\n\nLook at the planets in muntha. They tell us the nature of events in the year or month.\nFor example, Jupiter in muntha may give good results, happiness from children and\nknowledge. Saturn in muntha may make one sluggish, unhealthy, frustrated and\nsorrowful. Of course, the strength of the planets influencing muntha also matters. For\nexample, an afflicted and weak Jupiter in muntha may give loss of position, bad\nname and scandals.\n\nPosition of muntha in various houses with respect to lagna in the annual chart also\ntells us the nature of events in a year. Situation of muntha in the 9th, 10th and 11th\nhouses is excellent. It gives prosperity, status and gains respectively. Situation of\nmuntha in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th houses is also good. It gives health, wealth, success\nand fame respectively. Situation of muntha in the 6th, 8th and 12th houses is bad. It\ngives illness, troubles and expenditures respectively. Situation of muntha in the 4th\nhouse gives disputes and loss of position. Situation of muntha in the 7th house also\ngives troubles in marriage and many hardships.\n\nIn Tajaka analysis, we consider the following aspects:79\n\n(1) Trinal aspect: A planet has a strong benefic aspect on the 5th and 9th houses\n from it and on the planets in those houses.\n(2) Sextile aspect: A planet has a weak benefic aspect on the 3rd and 11th houses\n from it and on the planets in those houses.\n(3) Square aspect: A planet has a weak malefic aspect on the 4th and 10th houses\n from it and on the planets in those houses.",

At\n180º from its deep exaltation point, a planet is deeply debilitated and it gets 0 units of\nuchcha bala.\n\nWe can find the longitude difference between a planet’s position and its deep\ndebilitation point and divide it by 180º to get the fraction that shows how far away it\nis from its debilitation point. Bu multiplying 20 units with this fraction, we get\nuchcha bala.\n\nFor example, suppose Jupiter is at 8Vi30 (8°30' in Vi). So he is at 158°30' from the\nstart of the zodiac. His debilitation point is 5° in Cp, i.e. 275°0'. The difference is\n275°0' – 158°30' = 116°30'. Because this is less than 180°, we don’t have to subtract\nit from 360°.\n\nNow 116°30'/180° = 0.6472.

We can add\nor subtract multiples of 360º from a longitude to reduce it to the range 0º to 360º. By\nsubtracting 360º, we get 212°30'. This means that artha saham is at 212°30'. This\nmeans 2°30' in Sc or simply 2 Sc 30. Now we have to check whether the C is\nbetween B and A in A – B + C.

Lagna lord\nSaturn is at 19 Ar 10, i.e. 19°10'. Mars is at 24 Pi 58, i.e. 354°58'. Lagna is at\n280°50'. So samartha saham = 19°10' – 354°58' + 280°50' + 360º.

This yoga gives disappointments, worries and illnesses.\n\nIf two planets have an aspect and if the faster moving planet83 is less advanced in its\nrasi than the slower moving planet, then we have an ithasala yoga between the two.\nIn western astrology, this is called an “applying aspect”.\n\n83 In the increasing order of speed, planets can be listed as: Saturn, Rahu/Ketu, Jupiter, Mars, Sun,\nVenus, Mercury and Moon.\n\nResults: This is a good yoga and this shows fulfillment of the matters represented by\nthe two planets in ithasala. Suppose we want to analyze prospects for a particular\nmatter. Then ithasala involving lagna lord, lord of the related house, lord of the\nrelated saham or the naisargika karaka (natural significator) will show good results\nrelated to the matter. For example, ithasala between lagna lord and 7th lord (or the\nlord of vivaha saham or Venus) shows that the native may get married in the year.",

Moon’s\nadvancement in his rasi is 14º and Venus’s advancement in his rasi is 19º. Faster\nplanet (Moon) is less advanced than the slower planet (Venus). So we have ithasala\nyoga.\n\nTypes of Ithasala: There are 3 types of ithasala yoga.\n\n(i) Vartamaana ithasala yoga results when the planets aspect each other and both are\nwithin the deeptaamsa (orb) of the other planet. Vartamaana means present (current).\nIn the above example, Venus is at 19º and his deeptaamsa extends from 12º to 26º.\nMoon is within his deeptaamsa. Venus is also within Moon’s deeptaamsa. So we\nhave vartamaana ithasala.\n\n(ii) Poorna ithasala yoga results when the planets aspect each other closely and their\nadvancements in respective rasis are within 1º of each other. Poorna means complete.\nPoorna ithasala is the most powerful ithasala. It shows speedy fulfillment of the\nmatter. In the above example, the difference between the advancements of Moon and\nVenus in respective rasis is 19º–14º = 5º. This is more than 1º. So we don’t have a\npoorna ithasala. Now let us say that Moon is at 18º25' in Le (instead of 14° in Le).\nThen also we have an ithasala because Moon is behind Venus. The difference\nbetween the advancements is only 0°35', i.e. less than 1°. So we have a poorna\nithasala now.\n\n(iii) Bhavishya ithasala yoga is formed if vartamaana ithasala yoga is about to be\nformed when the faster moving planet moves by 1º or less. Bhavishya means future.\nBhavishya ithasala shows fulfillment after some obstructions or delay. Suppose\nMoon is at 13°35' in Le and Venus is at 21º20' in Le. There is a sextile aspect.\nMoon’s deeptaamsa is 12º and hence his sextile aspect on Li extends from 1º35' to\n25º35' in Li (subtract and add 12º, Moon’s deeptaamsa, from/to 13º35'). Venus is\nwithin Moon’s deeptaamsa. However, Moon is just outside the deeptaamsa of Venus,",

Moon is at 13°35' and\nthis is outside Venus’s deeptaamsa. So there is no vartamaana (present) ithasala.\nHowever, when Moon is the faster planet and he needs to move by just 0°45' (which\nis less than 1º) to come to 14°20'. Once he comes to 14°20', he is within the\ndeeptaamsa of Venus’s aspect on Le and we have a vartamaana ithasala yoga. So we\nhave a bhavishya (future) ithasala yoga when Moon is at 13°35' in Le.\n\nSpecial Notes: One should understand the meaning of these combinations and apply\nthem intelligently. The main criterion of ithasala is that the faster moving planet\nshould be behind. This means that the two planets will reach the same advancement\nin their rasis and have an exact aspect (sookshma drishti) very soon. If Moon is at\n14º in Le and Venus is at 19º in Li, Moon is going to reach 19º very soon and Moon\nand Venus are going to have an exact sextile aspect. So the energies of Moon and\nVenus are soon going to work in unison.\n\nThat is the main idea behind ithasala. If the faster moving planet is retrograde, then\nthe above is not going to happen and we no longer have ithasala. For example,\nsuppose retrograde Mercury is at 18º in Ge and Mars is at 18°10' in Li. One may be\ntempted to think that there is an extremely powerful trinal aspect and a poorna\nithasala yoga because the difference in advancements is merely 0°10'. However, that\nis not correct. Being retrograde, Mercury will go backward and Mars will go\nforward. They are not going to reach the same longitude anytime soon.

It, in fact,\nshows a faster realization, as the two planets will reach the same advancement faster.\nSuppose Moon is at 18º in Ar and retrograde Mercury is at 24º in Ge. Now both the\nplanets move towards the other planet and they are going to reach the same\nadvancement soon. So there is an ithasala yoga.\n\nSuppose the faster moving planet is retrograde and it is more advanced in its rasi\nthan the slower moving planet. In that case, one may be tempted to think that there is\nno ithasala yoga. However, both the planets move towards the other and so there is\nan ithasala yoga. However, a planet’s speed reduces under retrogression and the\ndifference in advancements has to be smaller. For example, suppose Mars is at 21º in\nCp and retrograde Mercury is at 23º in Vi. They have a trinal aspect. One may be\ntempted to think that there is no ithasala here, because Mercury, who moves faster\n\nthan Mars, is more advanced in his rasi. However, being retrograde, Mercury moves\nbackward. Very soon, Mars and Mercury are going to have the same advancements\nin respective rasis (perhaps near 22º). They will have an exact aspect then. So we\nhave an ithasala yoga.\n\nThus one should adapt the rules in the case of retrogression. Even when there is no\nretrogression, some changes may have to be made. Suppose Mercury is at 18º in Vi\nand Mars is at 18°45' in Cp and neither is retrograde. Then one may be tempted to\nthink that there is a poorna ithasala yoga in their trinal aspect. Now suppose that\nMercury is about to become retrograde and he will become retrograde after reaching\n18°05'. In that case, Mercury and Mars are not going to have an exact aspect anytime\nsoon, because Mercury will start going backward after reaching 18°05'.

Divide the number by 9 and take the remainder. See the planet\ncorresponding to that number. First dasa belongs to that planet. After that, dasas will\nfollow the normal order. Remainder of 0 is equivalent to 9 and hence shows Venus.\n\nIn Example 122, natal Moon is in Uttaraashaadha constellation. So the first dasa\nbelongs to Sun. The number corresponding to Sun is 1. Number of completed years\nis 1993-1972=21. Adding 1 and 21, we get 22. Dividing it by 9, we get a quotient of\n2 and a remainder of 4. That shows Rahu.\n\nFor finding the dasa balance, the fraction of the natal Moon’s constellation yet to be\ntraversed is taken.\n\nIn Example 122, natal Moon is at 29 Sg 28. About 0.79 of the constellation is yet to\nbe traversed by natal Moon. So the balance in Rahu’s Varsha Vimsottari dasa of\n1994-94 is 0.79 x 54 solar days = 42.66 solar days. So June 1-July 14, 1993 is Rahu\ndasa. Jupiter dasa runs for 48 days then.\n\nJupiter is 7th lord and vivaha saham lord in rasi chart. He is in lagna. In navamsa, he\nis lagna lord and occupies the 2nd house of family with Venus.\n\nIt may, however, be noted that Mercury is a better candidate for giving marriage, for\nthe reasons mentioned earlier. Patyayini dasa shows the event better than Mudda\ndasa.\n\nThis is essentially Narayana dasa compressed from 120 years88 to 360 solar days. If a\nrasi’s dasa is of n years, it becomes 3 x n solar days after compression, i.e. a period in\nwhich Sun moves by (3 x n)º.\n\nWe find the dasa order in Narayana dasa of rasi chart and Narayana dasa of\ndivisional charts just as in natal charts. The only difference is that we should\nprogress natal lagna and use it, instead of lagna in the annual chart.",

In other words, we take muntha as lagna when finding Varsha\nNarayana dasa. This is the link between the natal chart and the Tajaka chart.\n\nLet us take Example 122 and find Varsha Narayana dasa of D-9. Natal lagna is in\nAries. Because the native started the 22nd year in 1993, we find the 22nd house, i.e.\nthe 10th house (after removing 12), from Ar and get muntha in Cp.\n\nWe now find Varsha Narayana dasa assuming that lagna in rasi chart is in Cp. To\nfind Narayana dasa of D-9, we need the 9th lord in rasi chart. Vi is the 9th from Cp\nand Mercury owns it. He is in Sc in navamsa and Sc is stronger than Ta. So we start\ndasas from Sc. Normally the dasa order should have been Sc, Ge, Cp, Le, Pi, Li etc.\n\n88 Sum of the 2 cycles of Narayana dasa for natal charts is 12 x 12 = 144 years. However, only the\nfirst 120 years of this is valid, as the paramayush of human beings is 120 years.\n\nBut Saturn is in Sc and the “Saturn exception” applies. So dasas go as Sc, Sg, Cp,\nAq, Pi, Ar etc.\n\nSc, Sg, Cp and Aq dasas are of 7, 4, 2 and 3 years respectively. After compressing to\none year, they are of 21, 12, 6 and 9 solar days respectively. This covers 48 solar\ndays and these dasas run from June 1-July 20, 1993. Pisces dasa of 33 days started\nthen and it brought marriage.\n\nWhy Pisces dasa? Well, it contains lagna in D-9 and has subhaargala from lagna lord\nJupiter and Venus. Navamsa lagna’s dasa as per Varsha Narayana dasa of navamsa is\nan ideal candidate for bringing marriage.",

We should write down the bhava\nchakra with respect to lagna, Moon and Sun in the inner, middle and outer charts. To\nillustrate this, let us take the rasi chart given in Chart 72. Sudarsana Chakra for this\nchart is given in Figure 4.\n\nThe 10th house from lagna is in Sg and it has Ketu. The 10th house from Moon is Sc\nand it is empty. The 10th house from Sun is Aries and it is empty. We should analyze\nall the 3 factors together to draw conclusions.\n\nDasas of the 12 houses run in cycles throughout a native’s life. Each dasa is for one\nyear. For example, dasa of the 1st house runs in the 1st year of one’s life. Dasa of the\n2nd house runs in the 2nd year of one’s life. After 12 years, dasa of the 1st house will\nreturn in the 13th year. Dasa of the 2nd house will return in the 14th year. After every\n12 years, the same dasas keep coming.\n\nOne year stands for a solar year here. A new dasa starts after every one year. The\nexact date and time when a new SC dasa starts can be found by casting Tajaka\nannual chart. Look at the number of years completed. Adding one to it, you get the\nyear that starts. Divide it by 12 and find the remainder (if the remainder is zero,\nmake it 12). This remainder gives the house whose dasa runs in the year.\n\nFor example, let us take a native who finishes 44 years and starts the 45th year of his\nlife on a particular date. Because the remainder when 45 is divided by 12 is 9, SC\ndasa of the 9th house runs in the 45th year.\n\nWhen we say dasa of the 9th house here, we mean the 9th house from lagna, Moon\nand Sun. If lagna is in Pi, Moon is in Aq and Sun is in Cn, then the 9th house is in Sc,\nLi and Pi.\n\nHowever, analyzing with 3 signs becomes difficult. So one may conveniently choose\nthe strongest reference out of lagna, Moon and Sun and take dasas from it. This is\nonly an approximation, but it simplifies analysis.",

Antardasas\nin this dasa go as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq etc.\n\nWe can use Tajaka monthly charts to find the date and time when an antardasa starts.\n\nSimilarly, we can find pratyantardasas from antardasas and use Tajaka sixty-hour\ncharts to find the date and time when a pratyantardasa starts.\n\nIn short, Tajaka annual, monthly and sixty-hour charts are nothing but the entry\ncharts of dasas, antardasas and pratyantardasas as per Sudarsana Chakra dasa.\nMuntha in Tajaka annual charts is nothing but the dasa sign as per Sudarsana Chakra\ndasa, but always reckoned from lagna.

For example, an approach may assume that nobody is born during a\nperiod of 3 minutes and people can be born in a period of half a minute then. Then\nagain, nobody is born for 3 minutes and people can be born in a period of half a\nminute following it. Like this, time is divided into certain quanta in which people can\nbe born. Then we find the nearest “human birth can happen now” quantum from the\nreported birthtime and use it as the rectified (corrected) birthtime.\n\nOut of these methods, some of the reasonable methods are the ones based on (a)\nTattva siddhaanta, (b) Pranapada lagna in navamsa, and, (c) Kunda. The first method\nbeyond the scope of this book and the other two fail the acid test of twins. If we were\nto apply those methods to the charts of twins born 2 minutes apart, the rectified\nbirthtimes of the two twins would be either the same or too far apart.",

The only correct way to rectify a birthtime is to find a time in the\nneighborhood of the reported birthtime so that we can explain the nature, credentials,\nattitude and aptitude of the native and the known events from the native’s past. This\nis a laborious process, but there is no other way.\n\nSuppose we are told that one was born between 9:02 and 9:08 am and suppose we\nare looking at his chart. Because we don’t know the exact birthtime, we can look at a\nrange. If we do that, we are potentially looking at thousands of people born during\nthat time. Our native could be anyone among thousands of people born in that range.\n\nBut all those thousands of people have significant differences. We want to identify\nour native among those thousands of people and the only way is to look at the known\npast. That’s the only thing that distinguishes him from others born closely.\n\nSo we should look at 9:02, 9:03, 9:04 etc and see which one explains the known past\nbetter. The rectified birthtime is the birthtime with which the known life events of\nthe native make sense.\n\nWhen we try different birthtimes, all the computations change. If we know how\nvarious computations are altered based on small changes in the birthtime, we can\napproach the problem of birthtime rectification intelligently. We will discuss the\napproximate impact of birthtime change on various computations.\n\nPositions of planets in rasi chart and divisional charts change very slowly. For\nexample, Sun stays in one rasi for 30 days. He changes rasi in D-10 once in 30/10=3\ndays. He changes rasi in D-24 once in every 30/24=1.25 days. The speed of Mercury,\nVenus and Mars is comparable to Sun’s. Jupiter and Saturn are even slower. Moon is\nfaster than all these planets. He stays in one rasi for 2.5 days or 60 hours. He changes\nrasi in D-10 once in 60/10=6 hours. He changes rasi in D-24 once in every 60/24=2.5\nhours.",

However, if a planet is at a\nborder and changes rasi in a divisional chart during those 5 minutes, we have to take\nthat into consideration. Suppose Moon is is at 23Sc59. Suppose That places him in\nthe 8th dasamsa of Sc, i.e. Aq. Suppose lagna in D-10 is Cn. So D-10 has lagna lord\nin 8th. This makes the D-10 chart weak. On the other hand, it Moon is at 24Sc00 or\nabove, he will be in the 9th dasamsa of Sc, i.e. Pi. This puts lagna lord in 9th in D-10\nand the chart is strengthened. Because Moon moves by one quarter of a nakshatra (or\n200 arc-min) in 6 hours (or 360 min), he takes 360/200=1.8 min to move by 1 arc-\n\nmin. For Moon to go from 23Sc59 to 24Sc00, it only takes about 2 minutes.90 If we\ncannot rule out an error of 2 minutes, we should consider Moon in both Aq and Pi\nand see which one explains the native’s career better.\n\nThus, we should pay attention if any planet is at a rasi border in the divisional chart\nof interest. If so, we must consider both the positions and see which one makes better\nsense based on known past.\n\nLagna changes rasi in divisional charts much faster than planets. So it is the most\nimportant consideration in birthtime rectification.\n\nLagna moves by one rasi (30º) in 2 hours or 120 min. To move by 1º, lagna takes\nabout 4 min.\n\nLesson: Lagna moves by 1º in 4 min. Lagna moves by 10' in 2/3 min (or 40\nseconds). Lagna moves by 1' in 4 sec. Lagna moves by 10'' in 2/3 sec.\n\nWe can see that lagna changes rasi in D-10 in 12 min. It changes rasi in D-24 in 5\nmin.",

Lagna at 4Sg39 puts lagna in these 3 charts in Cp, Cp and Sc\n(respectively). Suppose the birthtime is reasonably accurate and the maximum error\nis 5 minutes (i.e. birthtime can be 9:00-9:10). Let us find the possible lagnas in the 3\ncharts.\n\nAn error of 5 min changes lagna by about 5/4=1.25º or 1º15'. So, instead of being\n4Sg39, it can be as low as 3Sg24 or as high as 5Sg54. So we should consider all\nlagnas between 3Sg24 and 5Sg54. In D-10, lagna changes rasi at multiples of 3º. So\nthe whole range we have for lagna results in the same D-10 lagna (Cp).

So we have to add 1º21' or higher to lagna. Lagna moves by 1º21' or 81' in\n81x4 sec = 324 sec = 5 min 24 sec.\n\nThis means that the birthtime should be 9:10:24 instead of 9:05.

On the other hand, using an approximate\nlinear formula for ayanamsa brings minor discrepancy in Sun’s longitude which is\nmultiplied by 360 in the longitude of lagna. This results in a serious error. Though\nwe do not know exactly when Nirayana zodiac coincided with the Sayana zodiac, we\ndo know the exact nonlinear formula of the precession. So one hoping to use Tajaka\ncharts in birthtime rectification must use the correct nonlinear formula of the\nayanamsa of one’s choice. Unfortunately, many people use linear approximations.\nThey are not good enough for Tajaka charts.\n\nIt is a good idea to first determine the correct D-9 lagna or D-10 lagna and then go to\nthe other divisional charts. We should first determine that the birthtime is between\n9:05 and 9:15. Then we can determine that it is between 9:07 and 9:11. Then we can\nuse a more precise criterion and narrow down further. Thus we narrow down further\nand further with each criterion.\n\nIf one’s marriage has already taken place, we can use D-9 to see it and fix D-9 lagna.\nIf not, we can see one’s general sense of duty, one’s basic skills and one’s interaction\nwith others and fix D-9 lagna based on them.

His D-4 and D-9 are shown in\nChart 75 and his D-10 and D-24 are shown in Chart 76.\n\nLagna with the reported birthtime is at 13Cp16. Let us approach the problem of\nrectification in a pyramid-like approach. First let us verify D-4 lagna. The native left\nhis motherland and went to USA in Jupiter dasa. In D-4, Jupiter owns 9th (flourishing\nabroad) and 12th (staying away from motherland) and he occupies the 7th house (long\njourneys). Rahu is the primary significator of foreign residence and he joins Jupiter.\nFor these reasons, Jupiter dasa can certainly take him abroad.

So we conclude that lagna is between 7Cp30 and\n15Cp00.\n\nNext, let us look at navamsa. In navamsa, lagna changes rasi at multiples of 3º20'.\nHere is changes at 13Cp20. The given lagna (13Cp16) is just below it. We see from\nChart 75 that navamsa lagna is in Ar. However, with a very small error, it can be Ta\nalso. Let us consider both.\n\nIf we take navamsa lagna in Ar, the native should be dynamic (Ar), spiritual and\npossibly short-tempered (Ketu). With Venus and Moon in trines, he should be skilled\nat singing or other arts. But he isn’t. With Mercury in the 2nd house, he should be a\nskilled speaker.

So\nprobably lagna is above 13Cp20.\n\nWe have narrowed to the range 13Cp20-15Cp00, based on lagna in D-4 and D-9.\nNow let us consider D-10, the chart of career. The native is a dynamic software\nengineer. In D-10, AL shows one’s status in career and how people perceive one.\nHere AL is in Virgo and its lord Mercury aspects it. So he is perceived in his career\n\nas an intelligent person (Virgo and Mercury). The 10th house from AL has Mercury\nand Mars and it can explain a career in software.\n\nSo probably lagna in D-10 is correct. This confirms that lagna is between 12Cp00\nand 15Cp00. But we have no further narrowing down because of D-10. We still have\n13Cp20-15Cp00 as the rectified window.\n\nNow let us go to a higher level divisional chart and take D-24, the chart of education\nand learning. The native studied computer science at a good engineering college in\nIndia during his Jupiter dasa. With lagna in Ta, the 4th house of education is in Le.\nSun owns it. Rahu, Ketu, Venus and Mars aspect it. With this, education in medicine\nor management is likely. Education in computer science is unlikely.

Mercury and Virgo\ncan give education in computer science. Jupiter is in own house. He aspects the 4th\nhouse and joins 4th lord Mercury. So his dasa can give education.

We can\nalso use Kalachakra dasa.\n\nWith a birthtime of 10:36 am, we have lagna at 13Cp16 and Kalachakra dasa of Ta\nruns from 1987 to 2003. The native got married at the end of 1996. Ta dasa makes\nsense because navamsa lagna is in Ta. We should look at antardasa now. Pi antardasa\nstarts in May 1995, Ar antardasa in April 1997 and Ta antardasa in Aug 1998.\n\nBecause the rectified birthtime has to be between 13Cp45 and 15Cp00, let us first try\n13Cp45. We need to add half a degree to lagna. So we need to add 2 minutes to\nbirthtime and make it 10:38 am. The paramayush is 86 years and if we add 2 minutes\nto the birthtime, we should subtract 82x2 = 164 days from dasa dates.

With Ta being lagna and Ge being the\n7th house from Venus, marriage is most likely in Ta and Ge antardasas. So the start\ndate of Ta antardasa must be moved from Feb 1998 to the end of 1996.

He is in Makha constellation, which runs from 0º to\n13º20' in Le. His advancement in nakshatra is (13º13'25'')/ (13º20') =\n(793.4167')/(800') = 0.99177. The same fraction of the entire zodiac is 0.99177x360\n= 357.0375º = 357º 2' 15''. Adding this to lagna, we get Sree Lagna. Lagna is at\n17º35'50'' in Pi. So we get Sree Lagna at 14º38'5'' in Pi. Sudasa starts from Pi.\nBecause Sree Lagna is in an even rasi, Sudasa goes backward. We reckon quadrants,\npanapharas and apoklimas backwards and get Pi, Sg, Vi, Ge, Aq, Sc, Le, Ta, Cp, Li,\nCn and Ar. Dasa periods are as in Narayana dasa. However, there is an exception for\nthe first dasa. Because Jupiter is in Pi, Pi dasa is for 12 years. However, only a\nfraction of this is left at birth, based on the fraction of the rasi yet to be traversed by\nSree Lagna. This fraction is (30º – 14º38'5'')/ 30º = 0.51218. So the remainder of Pi\ndasa at birth is 0.51218x12 years = 6 years 1 month 23 days.\n\nWhy did the native start feeling financial tightness in 1996-97? Libra dasa was\nrunning then.

So m should be\n720/(6x12), i.e. 10. We should add 10 minutes to the birthtime and make it 7:40 pm.\nHowever, after calculating Sudasa for a birthtime of 7:40 pm, we realize that the\ndates of dasas have moved by almost 2.5 years instead of 2 years91. To get dasa start\ndates 2 years earlier, we just need to make the birthtime 7:38 pm.\n\nWith this new time, Cn dasa started in mid-1996. With Cn being the 8th house from\nAL, its dasa gave financial tightness.\n\nExample 132: Suppose the rasi chart in Chart 78 is given to us as the chart of\nMicrosoft company’s Bill Gates. Suppose we have verified several divisional charts\nand they seem fine. Suppose we want to micro-rectify it.\n\nThe technique to be used for birthtime rectification varies from chart to chart. If\none’s D-10 lagna is close to a rasi border, we should use a technique that is sensitive\nto D-10 lagna and see which alternative makes better sense. If GL is close to a rasi\nborder, we should use a technique that depends critically on GL and see which\nalternative makes better sense.\n\nHere one can note that Sree Lagna (SL) is on a rasi border. With the birthtime of\n9:15 pm, SL is at 28Ar15. If a few minutes are added to the birthtime, SL will be in\nTa. We should use a technique that is sensitive to the rasi occupied by SL and see\nwhether SL in Ar or Ta makes better sense.",

So we should add a few minutes to the birthtime and\nmake sure that Kalachakra dasa of Aquarius starts just before her career is restarted.\n\nWe have so far looked at 4 examples. In the first example, we had to look at several\ndivisional charts to rectify the birthtime. In the second example, we rectified the\nbirthtime based on a dasa. We did it because the past events given to us relate to an\narea of life (finances), for which there is an appropriate dasa. In the 3rd chart also, we\nused the same dasa, but for a different reason. We did it because a key parameter was\non a rasi border. In the 4th example, we used Kalachakra dasa. Being a sensitive dasa,\nKalachakra dasa is usually very useful in carrying out a fine birthtime rectification.\n\nOne should choose the approach on a chart-by-chart basis. The information provided\nby a client about past events should decide the techniques to be used. Birthtime\nrectification is an area in which one can become good only after considerable\npractice.

Macro-rectification is the case when you have two or more totally\ndifferent birthdata from different sources and want to find out which is correct. For\nexample, there are different versions of Sri A.B. Vajpayee’s birthdata. If we want to\nfind out which is correct, we have to look at various divisional charts and life events\nand see which one works better.\n\nMicro-rectification is the one that we will need the most in practical consultations.\nThe birthdata reported by clients usually has a little error and we have to rectify the\nbirthtime.",

The only correct way to rectify a birthtime is to correct it in\nsuch a way that one’s nature and past life events are well explained. An astrologer\nshould have an idea of the change introduced in various computations if the birthtime\nchanges a little. Using lagna in D-9, D-10 etc, we can broadly rectify the birthtime.\nThen we can rectify it with a finer precision by going to higher divisional charts like\nD-20 and D-24 and using Kalachakra dasa. A couple of examples were provided in\nthis book. Readers should understand the examples thoroughly and practice these\ntechniques with as many charts as they can. The adage that practice makes one\nperfect is particularly true in this area. Readers should remember that correct\nbirthtime rectification lays a solid foundation for the entire chart analysis – without\ncorrect birthtime rectification, all other fine techniques we learnt in this book are\nuseless.\n\nGL in D-10 goes to the next rasi at multiples of 3º. Here it goes from Aq to Pi when\nGL crosses 21º. It goes from Pi to Ar when GL crosses 24º. So GL has to be at or\nabove 24Le00. So the amount we have to add is 24º0' – 20º 37' = 3º 21' = 201'.\n\nGL moves by 201' in 201 x 0.48 sec = 96.48 sec = 1 min 6.48 sec. So we should\nroughly add 1 min 7 sec and the birthtime should be 9:06:07 am or above.\n\nThere is an upper limit also. If it becomes too high, GL in D-10 will move from Ar\nto Ta. But we decided that GL in D-10 in Ar makes the best sense. So we cannot add\nanother 3º to GL. GL moves by 3º in 3 x 4/5 = 12/5 min = 2 min 24 sec. Adding this\nto 9:06:07, we get 9:08:31. So the birthtime should be between 9:06:07 am and\n9:08:31 am for GL in D-10 to be in Ar.",

If the birthtime\nchanges by m minutes, lagna changes by (m/120)x30 = (m/4)º. Moon moves by 3º20'\n(one quarter of a nakshatra) in 6 hours or 360 minutes. So, if the birthtime changes\nby m minutes, Moon’s longitude changes by (m/360)x(3º20'). So the fraction of the\nnakshatra occupied by Moon that is already traversed by Moon, changes by\n(m/360)x(3º20')/(13º20')=m/(360x4). When we find this as a fraction of the zodiac,\nthe change is 360ºxm/(360x4) = (m/4)º. The error in Sree Lagna is the sum of the\nerror in lagna and the error in this fraction of zodiac. So Sree Lagna changes by\n(m/4)º + (m/4)º = (m/2)º.\n\nLesson: Sree Lagna moves twice as fast as lagna.

The\nfraction (30º – Sree Lagna)/30º decreases by (m/60). If the complete length of the\nfirst dasa is n years, then the remainder of the first dasa at birth decreases by\nnx(m/60) years = (6 x n x m) days. If the remainder of the first dasa at birth decreases\nby these many days, all dasas come these many days earlier.\n\nFormula: If the complete Narayana dasa length of the first dasa in Sudasa is n years\nand the birthtime changes by m minutes, all the dasa and antardasa dates change by\napproximately (6 x n x m) days.

Though we\nhave a big change in numbers, it is a continuous change and 360º = 0º. So we need\nnot worry and we can use the above formula.

It may make sense to us, because Venus is the significator of marriage and\nbeing in an own sign or a friendly sign or a watery sign makes this watery planet\nstrong.

It will become clearer after\nwe make some calculations.\n\nSuppose there is no correlation between the above combination and getting married.\nThen let us find the probability of the dasa and the antardasa being one of the four\nsigns on a random date. We have 4 signs. To maximize this probability (i.e. go to the\nworst case), let us say that lagna is not in the same sign as UL or the 3rd/8th from UL.\nSo we have 4 signs out of 12. The probability that the dasa on any day belongs to\nthese 4 signs is 4/12=1/3. Similarly, the probability that the antardasa on any day\nbelongs to these 4 signs is 4/12=1/3. These two events are independent and the\nprobability that the dasa and the antardasa on any day belong to these 4 signs is\n(1/3)x(1/3) = 1/9. Expressed as a percentage, this is 11%.\n\nWhat this means is — if we find the dasa and the antardasa on any day, both belong\nto lagna or the 1st, 3rd or 8th from UL in only 11% cases on average. However, if the\ndasa and the antardasa on the day of marriage belong to these 4 signs in 45% cases, it\nis 4 times the exepected success rate. That clearly shows that there is a link between\nthe combination and marriage. This shows a statistically significant correlation.\n\nAnalysis as above does not directly help us in making predictions, but it helps us in\nvalidating atleast a part of astrology as a probabilistic science. Astrology researchers\nwho have the resources and skills should intelligently formulate well-defined\nprinciples, test them statistically and find the success rate and compare it with the\nexpected success rate as above. Instead of lamenting the rejection of astrology by the\nscientific community, we should engage in this exercise and convince ourselves first.",

We may not be able to explain the\ninfluence of planets on us on the basis of the scientific model of the universe we\nhave today. But that does not trivialize the statistical study of the correlations\nbetween planetary combinations and events in the lives of individuals.\n\nMany astrologers lament the fact astrology is not accepted as a science. But they do\nnot realize that a lot needs to be done before astrology is accepted as a science. A\nfew common problems are discussed in this chapter. It is this author’s hope that\natleast some readers are motivated to evaluate astrology using the tools given by\nmodern science. Spirituality, respect for Sages and scientific temper can co-exist.\n\nLet event A be: “dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by 3rd house”. Let event B be:\n“dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by 3rd lord”. Let event C be: “dasa rasi is occupied\nor aspected by BK”. A rasi is aspected by 3 rasis (by rasi aspect). So P(A), P(B) and\nP(C) are all equal to 4/12=1/3 here.\n\nSo the combined probability is (1/3)+(1/3)+(1/3)–(1/9)–(1/9)–(1/9)+(1/27) = 19/27\nor 70%. Though 75% is higher than 70%, it is not considerably higher. So there isn’t\nany statistically significant correlation.\n\n[Basically, combinations that are satisfied in 70% cases on average are poor\ncandidates for our studies. Even if the combination is satisfied in 90% of the cases\nwhen the event occurred, we cannot correlate the combination with the event with\nconfidence. On the other hand, if a combination is satisfied only in 5% cases on\naverage, we can suggest a good correlation even if the combination is satisfied in\n25% cases when the event occurred. Because 25 is 5 times 5, there is a strong\ncorrelation between the combination and the event in that case.]",

Those who have no\nbelief in Vedic remedies may skip this chapter.\n\nAn expert astrologer may be able to predict bad times and setbacks successfully. But\nwhat good is it for, if something cannot be done to avert the setbacks and bad times?\nA doctor not only identifies the disease one is suffering from, but prescribes drugs to\ncure it. Can we do the same thing in astrology?\n\nIn this chapter, we will take a look at remedial measures. Remedial measures are the\nmeasures that are taken to remedy the unfortunate situations that a native is going\nthrough or is expected to go through.\n\nThe pattern to be followed by one’s life is decided at the time of one’s birth by the of\nplanetary position then, which is in turn decided by the karma (actions) accumulated\nin past lives. However, it only decides the basic ‘pattern’ and not all the minute\ndetails. Though the basic pattern cannot be easily altered, the exact details can be\naltered by exercising free will. For example, one may be destined to have a vehicular\naccident on a particular day, but it can be a minor accident or a major one. Actions\ntaken by one’s free will have a role, along with the accumulated actions (karma) of\npast lives, in deciding the exact details. Remedial measures are the measures we take\nin order to manipulate the exact details to be relatively favorable to us.\n\nWhen we anticipate good happenings, we can afford to take a few risks. On the other\nhand, we can take extra precautions when we anticipate bad happenings. If an\naccident is possible in a period, we can drive very carefully or even avoid travel if\npossible. If quarrels with authorities are possible in a period, one can be extra careful\nand consciously try to restrain oneself.\n\nIn this manner, we can take common sense precautions to avert, or to reduce the\nimpact of, the bad events anticipated.",

With Rahu owning the 9th house, it had to do with religious\nplaces.\n\nIn addition to rasi chart, we can look at D-30. It shows the subconscious forces\nplaying a role in a native’s actions and his sins. In the case of a nation, it can show\ninternal turbulences, violence, riots etc. In D-30 (see Chart 81), Mars, Rahu and Ketu\nafflict the 9th lord Jupiter in the 9th house. Again, this supports communal violence in\nRahu’s periods.\n\nWhen Sun enters a rasi, it starts a new solar month. We can cast a chart for that\nmoment and analyze the fortune of a nation during the solar month. In particular,\ncharts cast when Sun enters the movable signs (Ar, Cn, Li and Cp) are important and\nthey are used by some astrologers to predict a nation’s fortune during a 3-month\nperiod.\n\nWe can cast the solar new year chart when Sun enters Aries, the first sign of the\nzodiac. This solar new year is celebrated in some parts of India. A chart cast at a\nnation’s capital when Sun enters Aries can be used for predicting the nation’s fortune\nfor one year.\n\nHowever, some astrologers prefer to use the chart when Sun enters Cp for predicting\nthe fortune for a year. They consider the solar ingress into Capricorn96 to be the most\nimportant solar chart in Kali Yuga.",

They give\nbetter results than Vimsottari dasa in the case of solar charts.\n\n96 This is celebrated in south India as “Makara Sankraanthi” or “Makara Sankramanam” or “Pongal”.\n\nExample 139: Let us consider Sun’s Capricorn ingress chart of 1998, erected at\nIndia’s capital. India conducted nuclear tests in May 1998. Let us consider D-24 (see\nChart 82).\n\nD-24 shows activities related to learning, science and technology. Scorpio is the 8th\nrasi in the natural zodiac and it shows hidden things. The 3rd house in D-24 shows\nweapons and aggressive technology. Rahu and Ketu in the 3rd house in Scorpio in D-\n24 of the solar new year chart suggest hidden activities related to aggressive weapon\ndevelopment technology. Lagna lord Mercury is in the 6th house and he shows\nenmity and poor relations with other nations in the matters of knowledge. This along\nwith the debilitation of Venus can explain India’s isolation in the scientific world\nfollowing the nuclear tests.\n\nWe can cast a chart when a new leader (the chief of the executive wing of\ngovernment) is sworn-in in a nation. That chart also has an impact on the nature of\nresults experienced by the nation during the leader’s tenure. We can find Narayana\ndasa of rasi chart and divisional charts of the swearing-in ceremony. We have to\ncompress Narayana dasa from 120 years to the expected maximum length of the\ntenure.\n\nExample 140: Let us take Indian Prime Minister Sri A.B. Vajpayee’s swearing-in\nceremony of March 19, 1998. Let us study D-9 and look at the relations with other\nnations (Chart 83).\n\nAn Indian Prime Minister’s tenure can be a maximum of 5 years. If we compress 120\nyears of Narayana dasa to 5 years = 60 months, i.e. compress each year to half a\nmonth, we get dasas as given below:",

If ayanamsa has an\nerror of 1 arc-minute, this results in an error of 360 arc-minutes (i.e. 6º!) in lagna of\nthe solar new year chart. This is because lagna moves 360 times as fast as Sun.

For example, for joining a new job, lagna, 6th\nhouse and 10th house should be strong in rasi and D-10 charts.

It should be a spiritual service.\n\nWith deep respect for my gurus and maharshis, I shared my limited knowledge with\nthe readers. May the readers of this book use the privileged knowledge of the divine\nsubject of Jyotisha in the spirit of compassionate and selfless service and work for\nthe uplifting of humanity!",

The exercises given in this book familiarize the reader\nwith various techniques, but making real-life predictions\nrequires more than that.\n\nTo illustrate the process of making predictions, some real-life\nsituations that this author faced in his experience will be given.\nThe process of synthesizing a prediction will be illustrated in as\nmuch detail as possible. These examples are meant for giving\nsome guidance and inspiration to those who are new to the\nprocess of making predictions.\n\nBirthdata of a lady is given in Chart 87. Her parents consulted the author in early\n1997 and wanted to know exactly when she would get married.\n\nFor marriage, we should see rasi and navamsa charts (see Chart 87). Vimsottari dasa\nof Jupiter started in mid-1996. Can Jupiter give marriage? Well, he must. Because\nthis dasa started at an age of 23, it will run till an age of 39. So Jupiter must give\nmarriage. Being lagna lord in 11th, he can give all-round progress. Moreover, he\naspects the 7th house Virgo and 7th lord Mercury here. So he can give marriage.\n\nWho is the 7th lord? In rasi, 7th lord is Mercury. In D-9, 7th is in Cp and its lord\nSaturn aspects it from Sc. So Saturn antardasa can give marriage. When is it? It starts\nin the second half of 1998. But her parents already started looking for a match and\nSaturn antardasa is too late. Can Jupiter antardasa itself give marriage? It is not very\nlikely.\n\nWhere will Jupiter be in late 1998? He will be transiting in Aq. Can Jupiter’s Aq\ntransit give marriage? It doesn’t look too interesting. Pi transit is a better candidate.\nAs Pi is natal lagna, Jupiter’s Pi transit can bring all-round progress. From Pi, Jupiter\nwill aspect Vi, the 7th house. He will also aspect Cn. Note that Cn contains 7th lord\nMercury in rasi chart. In D-9, it contains lagna & Mercury. So Jupiter’s Pisces dasa\nin 1999 can bring marriage.",

    "output": "The pratyantardasa running then is Mercury’s (Jan-May 1999). With Mercury\nowning the 7th house in rasi and occupying lagna in D-9, his PD can give marriage.\nHe is also DK.\n\nTo be sure, check Sudarsana Chakra dasa. On her birthday in 1998, she finishes 1998\n– 1973 = 25 years and starts the 26th year. Subtracting multiples of 12 from 26, we\nget 2. So dasa of the 2nd house runs. In navamsa, it is Leo. At the time of the start of\nthis dasa (i.e. Tajaka annual chart of 1998-99), Jupiter occupies Leo and Venus\noccupies Aquarius (see Chart 74). That is favorable. So marriage can take place in\nthe year (1998-99).\n\nIn Tajaka annual chart, lagna lord and 2nd lord have an exchange. The 2nd house\nshows family. Vivaha saham is in Sc. Mars owns it. Mars is also muntha lord. He has\na very close ithasala with Venus, the natural significator of marriage and upapada\nlord. In navamsa, Mars is very strong in his moolatrikona Aries. He is in the 2nd from\n\nlagna and 9th from muntha. Patyayini dasa of Venus runs during Dec 98 and Jan 99.\nPatyayini dasa of Mars runs during Feb-Mar 99.\n\nIn 1999, the lunar month of Maagha ends in mid-February. It brings the season of\nmarriages in India, because it is thought to be an auspicious month for marriages. So\nprobably marriage will take place in that month.\n\nSo the final prediction given was – “she may get married in the first half of February\n1999”. Because upapada is in Li in rasi chart, she was advised to pray to goddess\nLakshmi everyday and especially on Fridays.\n\nShe got married at the end of Jan 1999 and went to USA with her husband in early\nFeb 1999.\n\nA noted Vedic astrologer of the west was expecting a child in November 1999. At\nthe end of October 1999, he mentioned on an internet-based forum for Vedic\nastrology discussions101 that his child would be born in a few weeks.

    "output": "Later he expressed a desire on the forum to learn the computation of Narayana dasa\nfor divisional charts. This author wanted to illustrate the computation using the\ngentleman’s D-7, as he was expecting a child. His birthdata and natal D-7 are given\nin Chart 88.\n\nLagna in rasi chart is in Sc. The 7th house is in Ta. Its lord is Venus. He is in Ge in\nD-7 and Ge is stronger than Sg. So dasas start from Ge. Because Ge is a dual sign,\nwe use the trinal progression of Vishnu. Because the 9th from Ge (i.e. Aq) is an even-\nfooted sign, we go backward. So dasas go as Ge, Aq, Li, Vi, Ta, Cp, Sg, Le, Ar, Pi,\nSc and Cn. It can be seen that Le dasa runs during 1988-2000.\n\nIt can be seen that exalted Jupiter is stronger than lagna in D-7 and he can be used as\na reference. The 1st, 2nd and 5th lords from him are Moon, Sun and Mars and they are\n\nall conjoined in Leo. So Leo is a very important sign in this D-7. Its dasa can give\nchildren.\n\nLet us find antardasas. Because Le is stronger, antardasas start from its lord Sun. He\nis in Le, an odd sign. So antardasas go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc. During 1999-2000, the\n12th antardasa of Cn runs. It contains exalted Jupiter and it can give a child.\n\nPratyantardasas in Cn dasa start from Moon and again they go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc.\nMarch 13-April 13 is the first pratyantardasa. October 15-November 15 is the 8th\npratyantardasa of Pisces. From November 15, Aries pratyantardasa runs. Which is\nmore likely to give a child?\n\nPisces is the 11th house and contains the 5th lord Mercury. Mercury is also PK. He is\nin a trine from exalted Jupiter. So Pisces pratyantardasa is more likely to give a child.\n\nBefore it can be mentioned in public, it can be quickly cross-checked using the\nTajaka annual chart of 1999-2000 (see Chart 89).",

He also has an\nithasala with Jupiter, natural significator of children. In D-7, the 5th house is\n\noccupied by Mercury and Jupiter. Moon owns lagna and occupies 3rd (11th from 5th,\nshowing the gain of a child).\n\nAll these factors suggest a child in the dasa of Moon, who emerges as an important\nplanet in rasi and D-7. However, Moon’s dasa comes during June-July. Lagna’s\nPatyayini dasa runs during Oct 29-Nov 23 and Sun’s dasa comes after it. This\ngentleman said on Oct 29 that he was expecting a child in a few weeks. So it has to\nbe either lagna’s dasa or Sun’s dasa. Compared to Sun dasa, lagna’s dasa is a better\ncandidate. Usually lagna’s dasa brings important results. Antardasa is likely to be\nMoon’s. Moon’s antardasa runs on Nov 14-15. This agrees with the indication from\nD-7 Narayana dasa, viz child-birth before Nov 15.\n\nAfter this analysis, an e-mail was sent to the forum giving the computation of the\ngentleman’s D-7 Narayana dasa. It was mentioned that he might get a child before\nNovember 15.\n\nThe gentleman clarified later that the date given by doctors was November 23. He\nsaid that it was the third child and the ultra-sound scan predicted a daughter. The 3rd\nchild is shown by the 9th lord in D-7. Debilitated Mercury is the 9th lord from lagna\nin D-7 (counted in reverse). Debilitated planets show a daughter. Mercury also\nshows a daughter. We can now be more confident about child-birth in the\npratyantardasa of Pisces as per D-7 Narayana dasa, because Pisces represents the\nthird child in this D-7. So no changes were made based on the additional\ninformation.\n\nThe gentleman informed this author by personal e-mail later that he was blessed with\na daughter on November 14.",

It may be noted that Cp dasa of 10 years runs during 1989-1999.\nAntardasa running in March 1998-January 1999 is that of Aries. It is the 8th house\nfrom A10 (which can show the workplace) and its lord is in the 12th from A10. So a\nchange of job or turbulence at workplace is possible.\n\nBecause Ar contains AL and it is a trine from lagna, its antardasa is likely to be good\nfor career and status. However, its lord Mars is with Rahu in the 8th house from the\ndasa rasi Cp. So this indicates pressures and undesirable developments too. This\nseems to suggest worries at the current job and then move to a new job with higher\nstatus.\n\nThis can be cross-checked with D-10 of Tajaka annual chart of 1998-99 (see Chart\n91). AL in D-10 contains its lord Rahu and the other lord Saturn is in the 5th house\nfrom it. These factors suggest good status in career in the year. However, Venus\nowns the 7th from lagna (dealings with others) and the 9th from AL (fortune) and he\nis debilitated. This does suggest some setbacks. Moreover, Saturn and Sun aspect\neach other in D-10. This shows trouble from authorities.\n\nLet us check Tajaka monthly charts (Chart 92). In Tajaka monthly chart of May 26-\nJune 26, 1998, lagna lord in D-10 is Venus and he is in the 12th house with exalted\nSun, again supporting trouble from authorities. Moon and Mercury are with Ketu and\nRahu respectively and it does not suggest a happy mental and emotional state, as far\nas work is concerned. However, in D-10 of the next month’s chart, lagna lord Jupiter\n\nis in 10th in moolatrikona. Despite other weaknesses, this brings strength to D-10. In\nrasi chart also, 10th lord Mercury is in own rasi Ge (7th house) with 9th lord Sun and\nthis shows good developments in career.",

At the time of the original prediction, this author looked at\nNarayana dasa only upto antardasas. After he knew that the prediction came true, he\nchecked pratyantardasas (PD) in retrospect. Scorpio’s PD was running in June.\nBecause of the presence of 8th lord and debilitated Moon, its PD brought pressures\nand frustration. The conjunction of 8th and 12th lords can give a Viparita Raja Yoga,\nbut that can be effective only when the planets are in a dusthana in weakness or in a\nquadrant/trine in strength. Here Moon is debilitated and they are in a quadrant.\n\nAfter the frustration in Sc dasa given by debilitated Moon, next PD of Sg during July\nbrought success. He joined a better job. Because Sun is lagna lord and the lord of 5th\nfrom AL and because he occupies a trine from AL, this PD can be good for\nprofessional status. Because of his rasi aspect on Pi (GL), Sun can give a promotion\nalso. Moreover, Sun is the planet of authority. So Sg antardasa gave a new job with a\nhigher status.\n\nThe native came to this author again in May 1999. He was planning to buy a house\nin USA and wondered if his career would be stable or if it would be a mistake to buy\na house.\n\nLe dasa runs during 1999-2007.

So the native was told that there was nothing to worry\nabout and he might in fact have a promotion in the next few months. That came true\nand his position improved at his new company.",

In rasi\nchart, Venus owns the 8th house and he occupies lagna with Rahu in D-4. These\nfactors can suggest that his yoga will be in a foreign land. Vimsottari dasa of Venus\nstarted in April 1997 (using 360-day savana years) and the native left India and went\nto USA in April/May 1997. Venus dasa is likely to continue to be good for his career\nand finances.\n\nOn an internet-based Vedic astrology discussion forum, a noted Vedic astrologer of\nwest gave the birthdata of her friend’s son, who was nominated for an academy\naward (Oscar).

If one doesn’t get the award, one may be unhappy on that night and the\n\nnext couple of days. We cannot say that one will not get the award because a bad\npratyantardasa is running or that one will get the award because a good\npratyantardasa is running. We need to go much deeper and look at the 1-2 days\nsurrounding the award. We need to understand the native’s mood on the morning of\nMarch 27. That alone can say whether the native won the award on March 26 or not.\nIrrespective of whether one wins the award or not, a few weeks before March 26 and\na few months after March 26 are bound to be excellent in the native’s career.

However,\nexaltation of 6th lord is not favorable. Moreover Saturn is debilitated in 6th in rasi\nchart. That can show disappointments.

So irrespective of planets, this\nmust be the dasa of marriage. In any case, Venus occupies Sg here and it can give\nmarriage. Antardasa can belong to the 7th house Virgo containg Mercury. It can also\nbe Gemini owned and aspected by the 7th lord. Gemini is the 7th house from Venus\nand from dasa rasi. Gemini antardasa runs from Sept 1991 to Aug 1992.\n\nNext, this author checked the Tajaka annual chart of 1991-92 (see Chart 96). Vivaha\nsaham is at 22Ge54, i.e. in the 7th house. Venus is the significator of marriage and he\nis at 21Ge11. The situation of Venus in the 7th house very close to vivaha saham very\nstrongly indicates marriage in the year, perhaps in the Patyayini dasa of Venus.\n\nMercury is the 7th lord and vivaha saham lord. He is at 13Ar37. Lagna lord Jupiter is\nat 13Cn52. There is a square aspect between the two planets. Because Mercury is\nbehind Jupiter by one quarter of a degree, there is a very “poorna (complete)\nithasala” between them. This also makes marriage extremely likely in the year.\n\nIn navamsa, Venus owns the 7th house and occupies lagna. Mercury, lord of 7th in\nrasi chart, occupies a trine in navamsa and joins navamsa lagna lord. (NOTE: If the 7th\nlord in rasi chart is well-placed in navamsa, it is good. The 7th lord in rasi shows the\npartner in physical life and navamsa shows inner self and dharma.)\n\nVenus dasa as per annual Patyayini dasa runs from 9th Nov 1991 to 7th Feb 1992.\nVenus-Mercury antardasa runs during February 5-7, 1992.
