His penetrating approach to\nastrology has reclaimed many of its deeper aspects once thought lost. He\nis the author of many books in both fields and is a regular contributor to\nThe Astrological Magazine, The Times of Astrology and other astrological\njournals. In 1979, his manuscript which became the book, A Study in\nAstrological Occultism won the prestigious international Meyer Founda-\ntion Award of Switzerland for philosophy. His forthcoming books from\nPassage Press include: A Study in Astrological Occultism; Predictive\nTechniques, The Vedic Astrologer's Handbook VoL III; Career, Relation-\nship, Success and Vedic Astrology, The Vedic Astrologer's Handbook VoL\nIV; and Spiritual Prediction.\n\n Fundamentals of Vedic Astrology is the first volume of the Vedic\nAstrologer's Handbook and is the cornerstone of the series. It presents\nthe components of the astrological art - the planets, the signs, the houses\nand the lunar nnansions. These concepts are presented in the context of a\ncontinuing process of self-discovery and spiritual development. Bepin\nBehari's unique esoteric lens probes the rules which govern the\ndetermination of planetary strength, the constmction of the divisional charts (\nvargas) and the principle yogas or combinations. Fundamentals of Vedic\nAstrology is an extremely valuable tool for anyone who wants to learn the\nart of Vedic Astrology and the spiritual principles upon which this indepth\nancient science is founded.",

The Vedic\nseers considered the Jyotish Shastra, which dealt with the knowledge\nof the future, as an important limb of the Vedas. The antiquity of the Vedas\nthemselves is lost in archaic times and any effort to fix their origin is\nbeyond human capability. The authorship of the various scriptures is\nattributed to several different seers, but none of them clained originality.\nThey merely recorded the wisdom they had heard or remembered. Time\nhas not tarnished their work. During the course of human civilization the\nintellectual horizon of mankind has expanded and new lights have\nbegun to shine from the ancient wisdom. With every new revelation, the\nancient wisdom becomes yet more profound. But as yet, we have not\nsucceeded in identifying the original foundation upon which the\nsuperstmcture was raised, or the eternal spring from which these drops\nof nectar are drawn.\n Vedic astrology is not inductive. Its principles are not founded solely\nupon celestial mechanics by way of which generalizations can be made\nfor application to posterity. Vedic astrology reflects the understanding and\nperception of ancient spiritual teachers regarding the facts of life. If the\nreceiving instrument was not perfect and the reflecting medium free from\nevery distortion, the understanding of this mysterious life-process could\nnot be everlasting. Even when perception was free from any bias, the\nimparting of the knowledge had to be very carefully accomplished.\nEspecially when the wisdom had to be transmitted over a long period of\ntime, the language had to be such that the impact of tine was minimal\nOnly a language which arose from the very nature of the objects and\nrelationships it was designed to express could be useful in this regard.

Generally, a student interprets or bends the wisdom to suit and\nfit his own experience, understanding, and psychological propensities.\n The ancient seers did not inquire merely out of intellectual curiosity.\nThey wanted to understand the laws of nature so that they could adapt\nthemselves to these laws and enlighten the paths of other seekers.

The rate of precession is now\nidentifiable; however, this aspect of the problem is very complex and has\ngiven rise to different schools of astrology.

On the spiritual level, Mrigashira imparts intelli-\ngence while on the materialistic side it expresses itself in pure egotism.\nThere is an element of contradiction in the effect of this asterism.\n\n6. ARDRA\n Ardra extends from 66° 40' to 80° 00' (6° 40'to 20° 00' Gemini). The\nasterism is affected by all three gunas; rajas is the primary attribute, tamas\nthe secondary, and sattwa the tertiary. Its motivational impulse is kama,\nthe passional nature of man. Within the overall influence of Mercury,\nruler of Gemini, Rahu or the North Node of the Moon governs the\nasterism itself. Its four quarters are guided by Jupiter and Saturn. The\npresiding deity of the nakshatra is Rudra, the god of destruction.",

The exaltation of Venus in\nthe last quarter of Revati, the quarter owned by Jupiter, produces an\noverpowering sense of quietude, especially if it reposes there with the\nMoon, lord of Rohini, representing the foster mother of Krishna's brother\nand protector Balarama. Venus, being related to sex, encourages procre-\native activities which enhances the impact of Revati.\n\n Whether we consider the impact of Revati on the individual or in\nrelation to the cosmos, it leads to an infinite expansion of awareness to\nboundless duration, the dwelling of the seed of future growth in the infinite\nsea of quietitude.

The Egyptians associate the khou or animal soul with Venus and\nHindu Brahmanical literature relates the planet to Vijnanamaya Kosha\nand Manomaya Kosha, which are the seats of egotism and avidya (illu-\nsion), but all such associations are merely indirect pointers to the cosmic\nprinciple of attraction which results in procreative activity and the unfold-\nment of music, harmony, appreciation, and the urge to unite.\nConsidered a female, skilled in the art of love-making, producing the\nsexual and creative impulse in every human heart, Venus heightens the\nsensuous nature of man. The passionate urges of Venus are primarily of\nan intellec-tual kind, poetic in sensibility, artistic in expression.\nBelonging to the Brahmin caste and pervaded by rajas (activity), Venus is\nrefined, cultured, sacrificing and always engaged in activities. Though\nVenus is classified a female, this is primarily to point out its temperamental\ndisposition which emphasizes sensitivity, creativity, sociability,\nadaptability and ethics rather than the passion of lust; Venus is also\nconsidered a counselor of the planetary hierarchy and is identified with\nShukracharya, the son of a Vedic sage named Bhrigu.

But the real essence of propitiating Saturn\nlies in accepting the inevitability of its impact, surrendering oneself to\nGod, and orienting one's life toward a spiritual path. Saturn's mill grinds\nslowly and surely. Any effort to deflect its impact is bound to fail. But if\none can comprehend its basic nature and try to live in harmony with it,\nthe suffering is immediately relieved. From a purely material standpoint,\nSaturn is impossible to appease, but if someone adopts the right spiritual\napproach, its adverse results are turned into valuable boons.

For a birth date in 1986, it will be necessary to subtract a larger\nnumber of degrees and minutes than for a birth date in 1924.\n\n Western sidereal astrologers use an ayanamsha developed by Cyril\nFagan and Donald Bradley.

    "output": "BHAVAKUNDAU\n We have constracted the basic birth chart. Each of the boxes in the\ndiagram equals one sign of the zodiac; hence this chart is called the rashi\nkundali or \"sign chart.\"\n The rashi kundali worlcs quite well for most of the fundamentals of\nastrological interpretation. Hindu astrologers regard it as perfectly valid\nto interpret the chart as if one sign (rashi) were equal to one house (bhava).\nThis may be confusing to those trained in Western astrology, where the\nhouses are seldom equal. Nevertheless, it works. But Hindu astrologers\nalso use charts with unequal houses. In fact, there are as many methods\nof dividing the houses in Hindu astrology as there are in Western astrol-\nogy. In this text we shall make use of a method called the bhava kundali\nor house chart.\n\n We shall illustrate the process by using our sample chart. The two\npoints of reference for constructing the bhava kundali are the Ascendant\nand the Midheaven. We have noted that the sidereal Ascendant is 21° 53'\nLeo. (This implies that the opposite point, or cusp of the Seventh house,\nwill be 21° 53' Aquarius, a distance of 180'). Referring back to the Western\nor tropical version of the horoscope, we note that the Midheaven or zenith\npoint (the beginning of the Tenth house in Western terms) is 12° 25'\nGemini. Subtracting the ayanamsha of 23° 01', we ger a sidereal Mid-\nheaven of 19° 24' Taurus.",

    "output": "Our next step is to find the distance between the Midheaven and\nAscendant. The distance (in degrees) between 19° 24' Taurus and 21° 53'\nLeo is 92° 29'.\n Next, divide the distance between Ascendant and Midheaven by 3.\nThe answer is 30° 49' 40\".\n In order to find the house cusps, we keep counting from the Mid-\nheaven in 30° 50' increments. The cusp of the Eleventh house will be 20°\n14' Gemini; the cusp of the Twelfth will be 21° 04' Cancer. Thus we reach\nthe Ascendant or First house cusp again at 21° 53' Leo.\n This entire operation is repeated for the distance between the Ascen-\ndant and 4th house cusp (the Nadir), the distance between the Nadir and\nSeventh house cusp (Descendant), and the distance from the descendant\nback to the Midheaven.\n If you have a table of houses which includes the Porphyry house\nsystem, you can obtain these quantities at a glance. However, a Porphyry\nTable of Houses is not easy to come by. You are far more likely to\npossess a computer program which includes a Porphyry Houses.\n Even when you have obtained these house cusps, however, you are\nonly halfway there. In Hindu astrology, a house cusp refers to the center\n\nor midpoint of a house, not to its boundary or beginning. We must still\nascertain the boundary (bhava sandhi) for each house.\n The process is perhaps best illustrated using a Western-style diagram\nor horoscope wheel. (Remember, all diagrammatic representations of a\nbirth chart simply describe the same factors in different ways.) Having\nascertained our house cusps, we have a diagram that looks like this: (Fig.\n10).\n\n To find our house boundaries, we simply divide the distance (in\ndegrees) between each cusp.\n For instance, our sample Midheaven is 19° 24' Tauras, while our 1 1th\nhouse cusp is 20° 14' Gemini. When the distance (30° 50') is divided by\n2, we get 15° 25', which equals 4° 49' Gemini. This process is simply\nrepeated all the way around the chart for each cusp. Our final result will\nlook like this: (Fig. 11).",

It is also said\nthat the Sun casts an aspect with an orb of around 10° from the central\naspected point.

According to this rule, Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn, the\nmovable or cardinal signs, cast aspects on the fifth, eighth and eleventh\nsigns from themselves. This implies that cardinal signs aspect all the fixed\nsigns except the closest one. Aries, for example, will aspect Leo, Scorpio,\nand Aquarius, which are fixed signs, but not Taurus.

Under this combination,\nthe individual has a long and prosperous life, is blessed with children and\ngood health, and his name travels to the limits of the four oceans. When\nthe cardinal factors of an individual's life are well-energized, his status\nand activities become important; his influence expands widely and he\nbecomes greatly renowned. It is to be noted that this yoga is primarily\nrelated to personal satisfaction through receiving emotional benedictions\nwhich are not necessarily reflected in increased wealth. Wealth will\ndepend upon several other conditions, but occupancy of all the Cardinal\n\nhouses produces very satisfying emotional situations and the person is\nvery influential in life.\n In summary, the Cardinal houses are of supreme inportance. Unless\nplanets are posited in these houses, the life of the individual will\nremain at the level of mediocrity. If all four houses are filled with\nplanets, the person becomes world-renowned. If the Cardinal houses are\noccupied by planets in exaltation or their own signs, it shows a highly\nevolved soul (Pancha Mahapurusha Yoga). If such planets are afflicted,\nthe life may be full of struggle, but that does not change the fact that\nthis soul is very highly evolved and has an important mission in life.",

Occult literature gives descriptions of the trials of initiation\nwhich are similar to what astrologers describe as the significations of the\nEighth house.

The conquest or mastery of this inner fortress is the process\nof activating the Serpent Fire which entails much suffering, including\nseveral tests and trials which mystical occult literature compares to\ndecapitation, mutilation, death, and intense mental trouble. The purpose of\nactivating the Serpent Fire is to merge the individual in the Universal\nEntity. The arousal of the Serpent Fire, however, is a very difficult and\ndangerous process; it entails arduous preparations, intense pain and\nsuffering.

While dealing with the relationship\nbetween the Cardinal houses and the Spiritual Mangle, mention was made\nof the karmic forces influencing favorable opportunities, as well as\nadverse conditions. Here we wish to highlight the fact that man is a very\ncomplex organism and functions through several vehicles of conscious-\n\nness. In relation to the exaltation of planets, we hinted that the maturity\nof these vehicles is linked with planetary strength in the natal chart;\ndebilitation shows that the related vehicle is in a poor state of health and\nneeds extra care. The consciousness of the individual human being is\nrooted in and is a part of the greater being which we call the Cosmic Man,\nKala Purusha. The Sun represents the soul or atman of Kala Purusha\nFrom it flows a current of energy in the form of a ray of light which,\npassing through the various sheaths or vehicles of the individual's\nconsciousness, energizes them with this light; on reaching the physical\nbody the ray of light activates the physical entity which we call the\nman. In fact, this \"man\" whom astrology attempts to study is multi-\ndimensional. An inte-grated self implies that the flow of the atmic ray of\nlight from the central core of one's being (represented by the Sun) is\nunhindered till it reaches the physical brain, and that his actions are\nharmoniously blended with this central motivating impulse. The\nuninterrupted flow of consciousness through the various vehicles is the\ntouchstone of an integrated self. In the examination of such a relationship, the\nharmonious blending of the forces represented by the Sun, Moon, Ascendant\nand Ascendant lord is of utmost importance.",

For instance, if Venus is in\nLibra in the Seventh while Mars in Aries is in strength in the First, the\nindividual will have lustful urges and a great desire for amiable social\nrelationships, but Mars will make the First house so antagonistic to the\nsocial and sexual impulses of the Seventh house that these basic urges of\nthe individual will be stifled.

The Moon is the\nchannel through which the life-essence pours into the individual. It is\nimportant in the determination of one's life-span and general health\nconditions. The Moon is also connected with the Pitris, the guardians of\nhumanity, the progenitors. Through the medium of the Moon, all the\nimpulses which activate the human individual are energized. The fruit-\ngathering conditions of life as well as the action-oriented influences are,\nto a great extent, controlled by the lunar forces. Therefore, it has been\nsuggested that the horoscope should also be read as if the Moon were the\nAscendant — i.e. the house containing the Moon becomes the First house.\nIf children are signified by the fifth house from the Ascendant, they may\nalso be signified by the fifth house from the Moon. This principle is also\napplicable to the Sun. When examination of any aspect of life has been\nconsidered with reference to the Ascendant, Moon, and Sun, a final\njudgment can be made.",

Basically, it involves\nthe planet which rules the debilitation sign of the planet involved or the\nplanet which rules the sign in which the fallen planet would be exalted.\nThe most important variation involves three conditions.

In astrological\nprediction, one distinguishes three features in this context. First, legacy\nor inherited wealth, wealth given by others or wealth acquired by surrep-\ntitious means belong to one category of affluence. Second, income earned\nthrough one's profession through the discharge of social obligations and\nthrough that which may be termed one's vocation or calling is classified\nin another category. Third, there are situations when the wealth possessed\nby an individual has little relationship with the status he enjoys.

Astrologically, all three are distinguished according to\nplanetary combinations. Raja Yogas are popularly understood as\nconfigurations which bestow wealth and power, but this is a\nmisunderstanding. The confusion has arisen from the fact that ancient\nsovereigns enjoyed both power and wealth; such a position was related to\nplanetary Raja Yogas.

(Often there\nis a slight correction to be made, which is also generally given in the\nephemeris. For practical purpose,s we may ignore it, because very few\nbirths are recorded accurately to the second.\n\nSTEP TWO\n In order to find the longitudes of the different planets, we consult the\nephemeris. We will assume the date of birth is 8th Februrary 1925 at 11:15\nAM. Having converted the 1ST into Local Mean Time, we now consider\nthe time of birth as 11 hours 23 minutes 52 seconds on 8th February 1925.\nFirst we shall consider the Moon's longitude.\n\n From the ephemeris, we frnd that the daily motion of the Moon on\nthat day was 12° 5', which is obtained by subtracting the Moon's longirude\non 8th February 1925 as 21° 51' Cancer and 9° 46' Cancer on the previous\nday. This position is for 5:30 PM.\n To obtain the longitude of the Moon at 11 hours 23 minutes 52\nseconds, we have first to find —\n\n As the time of epoch is 17 hours 54 minutes after 5:30 PM on 7th\nFebruary, we have to get —\n\n The sum of the two is Log of 9 degress 15 seconds. Therefore the\nMoon's degree would be —\n\n(NOTE: The above calculation has been done with the help of a logarithm\ntable appended to the ephemeris, but the same can be worked out by siinple\narithmetical procedure on the basis of the time difference between the two\nintervals for which the longitudes of the planets are given; therefore the\ndaily motion of the planets is available for calculation.)",

    "output": "STEP THREE\n The determination of planetary longitudes is done similarly, on the\nbasis of their postions in the ephemeris. If the daily motion of the planets\nis given, one could easily, as in the case of the Moon, work out the exact\nlongitude of the planets. If the longitudes are given for longer intervals,\nthe method is the same, though the process may be a little more compli-\ncated. But given the position for two different points of time, and having\nthe time differential of the epoch from the beginning of the time interval,\nthe simple arithmetical calculations or those based on the logarithmic\ntables, the required planetary positions can be ascertained.\n\n For the above mentioned time, 11 hours 23 minutes 52 seconds on\n8th February 1925, the planetary positions would be as follows:\n\n 1. Sun 26° 10' Capricorn\n 2. Moon 18° 46' Cancer (as already worked out under Step Two)\n\nSTEP FOUR\n Having fixed the position of different planets, the Ascendant is to be\ndetermined. This has to be done carefully. Generally speaking, adjust-\nments have to be made in relation to the date, month, year and the place;\ntherefore one has to examine the ephemeris as to whether and how many\nof these adjustments are needed for the sidereal time given there. In the\npresent case, on the basis of sidereal times given for different dates of the\nyear, it is found to be 21 hours 8 minutes 51 seconds for February 8, for\nwhich the correction for January-February 1925 was (+ 2 minutes 28\nseconds), so the sidereal time for 8 February 1925 is found to be 21 hours\n11 minutes 19 seconds.\n\n The birth time is 36 minutes 8 seconds before the sidereal time, so\nthe sidereal birth time is estimated at 20 hours 35 minutes 11 seconds.",
