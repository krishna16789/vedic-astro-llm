Jyotish, then, literally\nmeans the Lord of light, with special reference to the Sun, Moon,\n stars and planets. It is a science of the study of heavenljr lights and\n their effects on human life. A t m a b o t i Parama Dhanla means that\natma (the soul) or pure awareness is also the light, and that one\nshould seek to attain that light of life with the help of Jyotish.\nJyotish helps to achieve the four main goals of human life: dharma\n(religious merit), artha (acquiring wealth), kama (worldly enjoyment)\nand moksha (liberation). It governs not only individual life, but\nglobal affairs as well. The study of the influence of light on every\nliving and non-living thing is the science of Jyotish. The word\n'astrology' has the same roots: 'astro' refers to the stars (the source\nof light) and 'logos' science. Everything in the universe is moving\nand changing, and that which is moving is bound by time. Stars are\nluminous bodies radiating energy into space. The rays of light:\nthen, come from the stars and planets, which are surrounded by\ntheir own magnetic and gravitational fields influencing this light.\nThc Earth, thcn, receives this light. According to ancient jyotish\nshastra (scriptures), Saturn is the most distant planetary body influ-\nencing the Earth, and the Moon is the nearest. The Sun is considered\nthe soul of our solar system. These light energies coming from the\nSun, Moon, planets and stars all separately influence the physical,\nenvironmental, mental and spiritual status of all beings. This light\nalso affects the dark recess of distant future. (Just consider the fact\nthat the light from many stars began its journey millions of years\nago.)

From the\n A.yzirvedic standpoint, every human being has a unique body type,\n called p r a k r h . Jyotish also believes that everyone has a unique\n planetary constitution. This combination governs the entire psycho-\n somatic make-up of an individual. The unique combination of every\n individual depends entirely upon the specific time and place of\nphysical birth. So it is very important to check in the ktfndali\n (astrological chart) for personal compatibility before marriage, in\norder to bring clarity, communication and success in marital life.\nPeople should platl well in advance for conception, building a house\nor beginning any auspicious work according to the most favorable\nplanetary positions.\n Just as imbalance of bodily dosha causes disease, likewise the\nundesirable effect of certain planets can become a causative factor in\nill-health. According to Ayzirveda, every individual has seven bodily\ntissues, and according to Jyotish they are influenced by the different\nplanets. For instance, the Sun influences consciousness and eyes, the\nMoon governs the mind, Mercury the intellect, and Jupiter super-\nvises knowledge. Mars is related to the blood and liver, Saturn rules\nthe neuro-muscular systems. Venus governs the reproductive system\nand artistic talent. Jyotish can be studied under several different\naspects: astro-physiology, psychology, etiology, pathology, symp-\ntomatology and therapeutics. like any other Vedic discipline, the\nstudy of Jyotish needs the guidance and blessings of a guru (one\nwho has mastered the subject) in order to have the insight to read\nand interpret the Jyotish chart. It is a wonderful healing science\nwhich can suggest certain stones, gems, crystals and metals in order\nto balance the undesirable effects of the planets. Jyotish also advises\nfasting on certain days to lessen these negative effects. It can also\nrecommend a proper mantra, aspect of God to worship, yagya (fire\nceremony) and certain spiritual rituals in order to neutralize karmic\nand planetary effects.\n In the true sense of the word, the science of Jyotish embraces the\nwhole human being in order to bring health, happiness and harmony",

This book\nnecessarily retains much original Sanskrit terminology because some\nSanskrit words and concepts simply do not translate directly into\nEnglish.

These\nSix Vedangas must be studied before one can attempt to comprehend\nthe Vedas themselves; they are Vyakarana (Grammar), Cbandas\n(Meter), Shiksba (Intonation), Nirukta (Etymology), Kalpa (Ritual)\nand botisb (Astronomy/Astrology).

The philosophical and\n religious ideals introduced into Indian culture by the Vedas have\n been amply fertilized by a wide variety of influences, both local and\n imported, and the immense mass of spiritual, ethical and religious\n vegetation which has sprung from these Vedic roots has come to be\nknown popularly as Hinduism.\n Although Jyotish is sometimes called 'Hindu astrology', this term\n is misleadingly sectarian, for it is also practiced by Buddhists, Sikhs,\nJains, Muslims and Christians, in many countries other than India.\nJyotish is 'Hindu astrology' in the sense that it is an outgrowth of\n'Hinduism', which is sometimes referred to as the Sanatana Dharma,\n'the Eternal Faith'. The Sanatana Dharma is eternal because it\nsprouts vigorous new growth whenever one of the saints or seers\nwho are its inspired founders receives new inspiration from the One\nAbsolute Reality. The Eternal Faith has grown over millennia into\na broad spectrum of religious attitudes, philosophies, sects, deities,\nrituals, and conceptions of Supreme Beingness, many of which have\nonly one thing in common: their acknowledgement of Reality's\nUltimate Oneness.

Our experience tends to bear this out. When complete, a Nadi\nreading traditionally consists of four parts: the first, known as bhava\nphala, deals with issues like career, marriage, children, health and\nfinances.

In\n an astrological context the word 'Tantric' implies a mystical and\n intuitive attitude toward Jyotish. Tantra calls for 'sacrificial rites',\n and a practitioner of Tantric Jyotish tends to rely on internally\n derived information over that collected from external sources, arriv-\n ing at startling correct conclusions via magical techniques.\n These techniques include but are not limited to the observation\nand interpretation of omens; the observation and analysis of the\n jyotishi's breathing patterns at the moment a question is asked; the\ninterpretation of a client's speech-patterns and actions; the encourag-\ning of spontaneous or forced visions; clairvoyance, clairaudience, or\n astral travel; the use of information received from ethereal beings;\nthe use of substances or techniques to induce such paranormal or\npsychic phenomena as the charming of objects or people, past-life\nreadings, miraculous cures, and the granting of boons; and the use\nof intense spiritual practices to bring the powers of nature under\none's direct and personal control.\n Many systems of divination around the world also employ such\ntechniques, but few who do past-life readings or trance channeling\nare practicing Tantric Jyotish.

Because the essence of the\nVedas is believed to be transferred to the listener when Vedic\nhymns are recited correctly, the Vedas must be studied vocally in\ntheir original Sanskrit if they are to be truly understood. This also\napplies to the Vedas' satellite vidyas such as Jyotish and Ayweda\n(India's traditional medical system). Other languages may convey\nthe vidyas' theoretical meaning, but only Sanskrit captures and\nconveys their quintessence.

Since knowledge of one model of reality enhances the\n understanding of other models, Jyotish has adopted Ayurvedic prin-\n ciples to enrich its medical knowledge, embraced the philosophies of\n Sankhya, Yoga and Vedanta to enhance its psycho-dynamics, and\n enlisted N-iti Shastra (political science) to teach jyotishis about secular\n dynamics. Sanskrit is crucial to a thorough knowledge of these ancil-\n laries, for specific word references within a work on Jyotish (words\n like pitta, karma, manas, b14ddhi and sattva) are meant to trigger mem-\n ories of the full implication of these terms in their original contexts.\nAny well-educated jyotishi who reads that 'manas is ruled by the\nMoon' knows what part of the mind manas represents and knows that\n it is something other than what we commonly express in English\nby the word 'mind'. Such words as these cannot be understood out-\nside the context of the Sanskritic system of knowledge, any more than\nsimilar modern technical terms can be used outside the context of\nthe psychology to which they belong.\n Some people who peruse Jyotish's ancient texts without first\nstudying their context conclude that Indian astrology is all prediction\nand no psychology. But Jyotish need not present psychology expli-\ncitly in its texts because psychology is explicitly presented in those\nauxiliaries (like Ayurveda and Yoga) which every jyotishi is expected\nto study. It would violate the well-respected principle of verbal\nfrugality to repeat such information in a work on Jyotish. Psycho-\nlogy is in fact central to each reading that a jyotishi performs.\nJyotishis use horoscopic insights to anticipate likely developments\non the concrete level of reality, and use their psychological skills to\nteach their clients how to cope with those potential results.\n Anyone who hopes to learn Jyotish, Ayurveda, Ashtanga Yoga,\nor Tantra must first learn something of the Sankhya philosophy,\nwhich is their structural basis.

It is the One,\nthe Supreme Singularity, the transcendent consciousness which is\nbeyond time, space and causation, the Reality which remains when-\never the universe ceases to exist. Creation begins whenever the\nPurusha desires to experience Itself; that desire causes a sense of\nseparateness to arise, which is known as Prakriti, or Nature, and is\nthe womb of the manifested universe, the macrocosm. Desire is the\nfoundation of the manifested universe. Awareness of this separate-\nness produces mahat, or bclddhi, which is transcendent, limitless\nawareness, and individuation of this awareness produces ahamkara.\n Ahamkara, which means literally the 'I-creator', is the force\nwhich provides beings with their individuality. It is the power of\nself-identification, the force that tells an individual 'I am performing\nsuch-and-such an action'. This power to self-identify with one's\nactions is the basis of the Law of Karma (see below). Ahamkara's\nThree Gclnas (qualities or attributes) are Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. In\nthe context of the evolution of consciousness Sattva represents\nindividuality that is relatively self-aware; Tamas, individuality that\nis relatively unaware of selE; and Rajas, the ability to become\nrelatively more or less self-aware.\n From Sattva arises manas (the mind) and the ten senses: the five\nsenses of perception - hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell - with\nwhich we import into ourselves things from the external environ-\nment; and the five senses of action with which we export things\ninto the external environment. The five senses of action are speech,\nwhich represents all forms of communication; hands (which symbol-\nize creative action); feet (locomotion); genitals (reproduction); and\nanus (elimination). From Tamas arise the five objects of the senses --\nsound, texture, form, flavor and odor - and from these objects arise\nthe Five Great Elements (Maha Bhtltas), the building-blocks of the\nphysical universe: Ether, Air, Fire, Water and Earth.

The\nMoon represents manas, Mercury characterizes buddhi, the ascendant\nor rising constellation indicates ahamkara, and the Sun stands for\nthe atma or jiua, the individual soul.

We cannot, in the context of Jyotish, speak about\n'quality of mind' unless we know which qualities of 'mind' are\nactivated within the organism at any one time.\n Manas, the most important of the various factors used to evaluate\nthe average person's mind, measures your likes and dislikes, the life\nexperiences to which you are attracted and the ones which you\navoid. Because people commonly become emotional over their likes\nand dislikes, the Moon's condition in the horoscope usually indicates\none's overall emotional state. Jyotish places so much importance on\nthe Moon because a strong, well-placed Moon tends to produce a\nstable, enjoyable life, while a disturbed Moon creates imbalances,\nleading perhaps to addictions or obsessions.

The nine states of relative\n imbalance which thus originate from the permutations of Sattva,\n Rajas and Tamas is one more reason why Nine Planets suffice to\n describe all of human nature and experience. In each human life the\n specific proportions of the Three Gunas determine, via the Nine\n Planets, that individual's aptitude for the various possible actions\n which a living human can perform.\n Though the Law of Karma is simply stated - 'as you sow, so\n shall you reap' - it is no simplistic, tit-for-tat theory, nor is it an\n arbitrary human creation. The Law of Karma is another name for\n Newton's Third Law of Motion: 'For every action there is an equal\n and opposite reaction.' As such, it is inherent in the universe's\n structure: 'The doctrine of karman and phala, act and fruit, is less a\n product of man's sense of justice, that one shall be punished for\n what one has done, than a necessary consequence of the doctrine of\n the inherent efficacy of the acts' (van Buitenen, p. j j).\n Everything does not happen all at once in our world, thanks to\n the inherent limitations of time, space and causation. A tree and the\n. seed from which it sprang cannot exist simultaneously; the former\n must develop from the latter. Events occur in our universe accord-\n ing to a sequence which is scheduled by the Law of Karma on the\n great calendar known as time.\n As soon as Prakriti separates from Purusha, the Law of Karma\n begins to operate, for everything that happens thereafter is ultimately\n due to that first act. Each action inexorably causes some effect, and\n each effect causes further effects, like ripples spreading from a rock\n pitched into a pool. As a myriad actions accumulate, the cascade of\n effects becomes exceedingly intricate and perplexing, embroiling us\n in extended matrices of cause and effect which bind us and the\n world together into a vast, self-regulating system. As Mahatma\n Gandhi is reported to have said, 'After inventing the Law of Karma\n God was able to retire.'\n In living individual beings the Law of Karma acts primarily at",

This will in turn enhance the\nlikelihood that the client will perform the action that is 'fated' by\nthose karmas. So long as an ishta devata possesses the jyotishi,\nhowever, the client's grahas will be unable to do so, and this will\nprovide the jyotishi with a bigger perspective, a greater reality from\nwhich to advise the client. An isbta devata makes it easier to live a\nlife in which you act of your own volition, instead of being per-\npetually driven by your karmas, or by the karmas of others, to act in\nfrequently undesirable ways.\n Another reason why those who practice Jyotish must cultivate a\nrelationship with a personal deity is that a jyotishi is always coming\nto crossroads in readings, at which two or more interpretations\nseem equally feasible. At these moments an ixhta devata can 'jump\nthe gap' in your model of reality and flash you the right answer.\nFluctuations in the mind occur because of the continual interchange\nof Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.

It was this strength that the\nrishis who originated Jyotish tapped into in order to collect and\nsystematize their astrological information.\n Though the worship of an ishta devata may seem to some an\nexercise in idolatry, the deities are really representatives of the One\nReality. When you worship a personal deity, you indirectly worship\nthe Absolute One, the Singularity who hides behind the mask of the\ndeity's personality. Worship of deities really means appreciating them\nfor the skill with which they play their roles in the cosmic drama.\nYou can also worship the One directly, but the One is undifferen-\ntiated, unqualified and absolute, while the world a jyotishi lives in\nis relative, qualified and differentiated.

Since classical Jyotish does\nnot mention this 'change' of motion, it is not regarded as the 'retro-\ngression' of the nodes.\n Retrogression always begins for the outer planets (Mars, Jupiter\nand Saturn) when Earth sits between them and the Sun. These\nplanets are always brightest, and therefore strongest, when they are\nnearly opposite the Sun in the sky, because it is then that we are\nclosest to them. Jupiter and Saturn move backwards once each year.\nMars is not as cyclical in his retrogression, which is one reason we\ncall him 'the Crooked' (vakrz). Vakri also happens to be the Sanskrit\nword for retrograde. Because Mars was observed to be independent\nin the skies, he gained a reputation for causing independence in the\nhoroscope. Here interpretation follows observation yet again.\n The situation for the inner planets (Mercury and Venus) is a bit\nmore complex. While Venus does not necessarily go retrograde each\nyear, Mercury retrogrades several times annually. Even though\nMercury's perceived motion is an average of I?' per day more than\nthat of the Sun or Venus, Mercury goes retrograde so often that,\nlike the Sun and Venus, it covers only one constellation every 30\ndays, on the average.",

We prefer the northern Indian style of horoscope\nmapping because it reflects astronomical reality by showing the\nhouses as fixed in space. Since the respective houses in this type of\nhoroscope always occur in the same places, jyotishis memorize the\nhouse positions in the diagram, counting them consecutively\ncounter-ciockwise, so that they need not identify the houses visibly.\n The constellations superimposed on each of the twelve houses\nwill, however, vary according to the ascendant at the birth time and\nbirth place, for a total of twelve possible arrangements. The number\nthat appears written inside each house of this type of horoscope is\nthe number of the constellation of the zodiac superimposing itself\non that house. The lord of that constellation becomes, in that\nhoroscope, the lord of that house. While the lords of the constella-\ntions are always fixed, the lords of the houses vary from horoscope\nto horoscope.

To translate the French expression 'monpetit\n C ~ O M ' into English as 'my little cabbage' is literally correct, but such\na literal rendering is absurd, for 'mon petit chom' is an idiomatic\nexpression which means 'my dear' or 'my darling'.

The majority of jyotishis agree that Rahu is exalted in\n Taurus and debilitated in Scorpio, and Ketu exalted in Scorpio and\n debilitated in Taurus. However, a small but significant group of\n jyotishis take Gemini and Sagittarius to be the exaltation and debil-\n itation constellations of Rahu, and Sagittarius and Gemini to be the\n exaltation and debilitation constellations respectively of Ketu.\n A very small group considers both Rahu and Ketu to be exalted\nin Scorpio and both to be debilitated in Taurus. This approach\nseems to be verified both by experience and by the logic of the\nscheme of exaltation. In this scheme the grahas form contrasting\npairs: Sun and Saturn, Moon and Rahu/Ketu (both nodes being the\nopposite ends of the same axis), Mercury and Venus, Mars and\nJupiter. For each pair of planets, the exaltation constellation of the\none becomes the debilitation constellation of the other, and vice\nversa. Within this framework it follows that the exaltation constella-\ntion of the Moon should be the debilitation constellation of both\nRahu and Ketu, and that the debilitation constellation of the Moon\nshould be the exaltation constellation of both Rahu and Ketu.\nThroughout this book it will be assumed that Rahu and Ketu are\nboth exalted in Scorpio and both debilitated in Taurus.\n A planet placed in its exaltation degree, or (practically speaking)\nin any other degree of its constellation of exaltation, attains its\nstrongest placement in a horoscope and so will exhibit its energies,\nfor good or evil, with great intensity. Exalted planets are not,\nhowever, always benevolent planets! Whether or not a graha will\ngive good results is determined by other indicators in the horoscope.\nAn exalted graha acting malevolently will cause exalted problems in\none's life, while a planet in its debilitation degree (or, effectively, in\nany other degree of its debilitation constellation) will express its\nenergies very feebly, because it has attained its weakest placement in\na horoscope. It may well be desirable for one's prosperity to have\ncertain planets debilitated (fallen) in one's chart, though certain\nmalefic grahas may actually become, for complex reasons, more\nmalign when fallen.",

For example,\nthe situation of Mercury in the constellation Virgo can be analyzed\nas follows: when Mercury is in the first I 5 \" of Virgo it is exalted, in\nthe next j\" it is in its mulatrikona, and in the last 10\" it is in its own\nnegative constellation. In actual practice mulatrikona is often ignored,\nsince most jyotishis see it only as a theoretical and pedantic considera-\ntion in the scheme of planetary strength. Here is one example of its\nuse: suppose a planet owns two constellations, one of which falls in\na bad house (see Chapter Six) and the other in a good house. If\ndoubt arises over how to interpret the planet's behavior, the planet\nwill most likely give the results of the house in which its mulatrikona\nconstellation falls.\n\n Friendliness and Enmi0\nJyotish is often taught by assigning human attributes to the grahas,\nand planetary relationship is a case in point.

Two planets are said to be at war when their longitudes are\nwithin one degree of each other. In this situation, whichever planet\nhas the higher latitude is declared the winner and is strengthened\nthereby, while the loser is weakened. Many modern books on\nJyotish however take the planet with the lower longitude to be the\nvictor. A planet's latitude can be found in tabulated form in a\nPandarzga (an Indian ephemeris; see Chapter Seven), but this is\nusually missing from a Western ephemeris.\n Another group of methods for evaluating strength are collectively\nknown as graha avasthas ('planetary states' or 'conditions'). Parashara\ndevotes a whole chapter to the subject, as do many other classical\nworks.

Most other diseases can be similarly\nclassified. For example, since Moon represents blood-related disease\nand Jupiter indicates circulatory congestion, a poorly placed Jupiter\nwhich has some association with a Moon which already indicates\ndisease in a horoscope may create high blood-pressure. If it is\nSaturn who influences the Moon instead of Jupiter, this may\nindicate chronic lung problems (like asthma) or chronic digestive\ncomplaints (like certain types of colitis).

This becomes\nuseful when estimating the distance of journeys, transfers, and\nsimilar phenomena, both in horary astrology and when timing\nevents from the natal horoscope.",

    "output": "The Sankhya philosophy claims that the whole of creation comprises\nfive basic states of matter (Maha Bhutas). These states of matter are\nalso called Tattvas ('things'), because they are the most material (the\nmost 'thing-like') of all the Sankhya philosophy's Tattvas. These are\nEarth (Prithvi), Water Uala or Apab), Fire (Agni or Tejas), Air\n(Vqtr)and Ether (Akasha). Earth predominates in everything in the\nuniverse which is solid, Water in every liquid, and Air in each gas.\nFire helps to change state, from solid to liquid to gas and vice versa;\nand Ether is the space in which all these other transformations take\nplace.\n One of the specific applications of this information is in the\nrectification of doubtful birth times. Another application is in\nSvarodaya, the science of Tantric breathing, which states that these\nTattvas rule in a certain order during certain times of each day.\nThere are several methods of deciding which Tattva is dominant at\na particular moment; one is to analyze the qualities of your inhalation\nand exhalation, as noted above. Knowledgeable jyotishis use this\ntheory to divine the success or failure of actions that their clients\ncontemplate, since certain specific actions performed during each\nTattva's period produce optimum results.\n Another application for this classification is to attribute the five\nsenses to each of the elements. Mercury rules the sense of smell,\nMoon and Venus rule taste, Sun and Mars rule sight, Saturn rules\ntouch, and Jupiter rules hearing. This is only one system of sense\nclassification, one which may owe a great deal to Tantric Jyotish.\nOne other system maintains that, because we see by the light of the\nSun and the Moon, these two luminaries rule the eyes, the Sun\nruling the right eye and the Moon the left eye because right and Sun\nare traditionally regarded as male, and left and Moon as female.

The differences of opinion which\noccur occasionally in the scheme of rulerships are really instances of\nthe overlapping symbolisms of the grahas.

Without such arcane procedures as the prana pratisbtba (the\n 'establishing of life'), few gemstones will give the sort of dramati-\n cally beneficial effects that the scriptures promise. While many\n people have read that the use of gemstones can radically improve\n their lives, most of them are unaware that, when used improperly,\n gemstones can disrupt their lives, particularly if they are worn\n without consideration for their possible effects.\n In particular, those who wear large, flawless diamonds or sap-\n phires must be very wary of potential calamities unless they are sure\n that those particular gems suit them. Both our gurus were extremely\nwary of the blue sapphire. On one occasion a man desiring to wear\na blue sapphire to increase his luck was told that neither he nor his\nmother might survive his wearing of the jewel. He insisted, how-\never, and tied the stone on his arm for seven days (which is one\napproved procedure for testing such a gemstone). After his mother\ndied suddenly within that week he promptly decided that the guru\nwas right, and he removed the gem. Nor was this some bizarre\ncoincidence; both authors have witnessed such events several times.\n In addition to all the above caveats, remember that, in the words\nof our jyotish guru, 'Gemstones are the game of kings.' Since a\ngemstone meant for use as a remedy must be flawless, of good color\nand of supreme luster, and must weigh at least three carats, such\nbaubles are very expensive. But a remedy should solve the problem,\nnot add to it. If you suggest an expensive remedy to a poor man, he\nwill become even more depressed for, while the promise of the\nremedy will tantalize him, it will remain forever outside his grasp.\nTo solve this problem, Jyotish also provides for tiparatnas ('substi-\ntute gemstones'). Although the zrparatnas are substantially weaker\nthan their precious counterparts, all the criteria of effectiveness that\napply to more valuable gemstones apply equally to the zipat-atnas.\nAmong these substitutes are:\nS U N rules garnet J U P I T E R rules citrine\nMOON rules moonstone VENUS rules white sapphire\nM A R S rules bloodstone S A T U R N rules lapis lazuli\nM E R C U R Y rules peridot or green R A H U rules agate\n tourmaline KETU rules turquoise",

The benejcs\ngenerally stand for qualities like growth, expansion and preservation,\nwhile the malefcs represent decay, restriction and destruction. Of\nthemselves these qualities are neutral, but from the human perspec-\ntive they are frequently characterized as being positive or negative.\nBoth sets of qualities are necessary; for one tree to grow strong and\ntall, many others must die in its shadow. Note that the malefic\nplanets outnumber the benefics. This is partly due to the fact that\nJyotish is a way of mapping karmas; since most people tend to\nperform those actions which they believe to be in their own self-\ninterest, the strongest karmas are frequently those which are most\nselfish, not the most altruistic. The more selfish an action is, the less\nbenevolent is the karma it creates.\n In Sanskrit a benefic planet is a shubha (a 'pious being'), while\na malefic is a papi (a 'sinner'). The malefics are 'sinners' because\nthey encourage the people whose minds they seize to scorn Nature\nand Her laws. Nature favors no man or woman: if you follow Her\nrules, you will prosper; if you flout them, you will suffer.\n Some jyotishis refer to the Sun as a natural malefic, others say it\nis merely 'cruel' (krura), and a few assert that it is cruel only when\nexalted, and malefic otherwise. Malefics are also cruel, but the Sun is\nless likely to cause a person to 'sin' than are the other malefics.\nThe Sun is fierce by nature but is not deliberately cruel; anyone who\nhas lived through a hot season in India knows precisely how cruel\nthe Sun can be. Astrologically, the Sun is cruel because he dries up\nthe rasa, the juice or nectar of life which makes life worth living.",

A rashi (literally, a 'heap of things') is\na heap of micro-zodiacs, or andas. Since every amsha, or portion of\nthe zodiac, is smaller than a rashi (ranging in size from I y o to jo',\nand, in Nadi Jyotish, to 6' of arc), they manage the rashi by\ndelineating results for specific matters within the broad context of\neach rashi. They are particularly useful to differentiate between two\nsimilar horoscopes. For example, everyone born within the two and\na half years that Saturn transits Libra will have Saturn in their birth\ncharts in Libra but, because most will have a different pattern of\namshas according to their specific times of birth, the differences in\nthe amshas will suggest differences in life experience.\n Parashara lists sixteen amsha charts (we can also call them\nsubcharts). Nadi and Tajika Jyotish add the fifth, sixth, eighth and\nthe one-hundred-and-fiftieth amshas. We will confine our comments\nhere to the ninth subchart, or nauamsba, which is by all accounts the\nmost important of all the amshas. One reason for its pre-eminence is\n\n the numerological fact that there are nine grahas. Another reason is\n the spatial fact that since the navamsha is the ninth division, each\n joo rashi is divided into nine parts of jo 20' each, a distance which\n happens to be one-fourth of a nakshatra (see Chapter Eight).\n Therefore nakshatras always start at the beginning point of a\nnavamsha and end at the terminating point of a navamsha.",

For example, the first navamsha in Capricorn is\nCapricorn, followed by Aquarius, then Pisces, Aries, Taurus and so\non up to Virgo.\n Note that the first navamsha for the cardinal constellation (chara\nrashi) is always that constellation; the fifth navamsha for a fixed\nconstellation (sthira rush() is always that constellation; and the ninth\nnavamsha for a mutable constellation (dvisvabhava rashi) is always\nthat constellation.

A graha which occupies the same rashi in both the birth chart\nand the navamsha chart is said to be vargottama (the best division).\nA planet can be vargottama in any of the subcharts, but this term is\nusually confined to its navamsha position.

For a Sagittarius ascendant, the tenth house is Virgo and the\ntenth lord is therefore Mercury. If Mercury is situated, say, at 9\"\nVirgo, it will fall in Virgo's third navamsha, which happens to be\nPisces. Since the lord of Pisces is Jupiter, that person would be\nlikely to follow a Jupiterian profession, like teaching, preaching or,\nin this case, possibly consulting (since we must include in our\ninterpretation the fact that the mercantile Mercury is exalted in that\ntenth house). There are of course other ways to determine profes-\nsion, but this example does indicate the great utility of the\nnavamsha.\n The navamsha is sometimes read like a birth chart, particularly by\nSouth Indian jyotishis, to help to refine predictions in specific\nrealms of life experience. Most standard rules of influence apply to\nsuch interpretations; for example, planets which influence the navam-\nsha's lagna affect both the general and the specific indications of\nthat amsha for better or worse, according to whether they are\nnatural benefics or malefics respectively. It is said that the birth\nchart represents the tree of a life, and the navamsha represents its\nfruit. Examination of the navamsha can help to indicate what sort\nof fruit can be expected in life, for you cannot tell the fruit just by\nlooking at the tree. Weak or ugly trees sometimes produce sweeter\nand more abundant fruit than do strong, handsome trees, and a\nstrong navamsha can often indicate good results in an otherwise\nweak horoscope.\n Some jyotishis follow another of Parashara's leads, however, and",

Many Indians\n mistakenly translate dbarma as 'religion', and render Sanatana Dharma\n as 'the eternal religion', when dharma is so much more than mere\n dogma and ritual.\n Dharma, which comes from a Sanskrit root meaning 'to establish',\n is that path through life which establishes an individual as a stable,\n productive, satisfied human being. The Sanatana Dharma, like the\nTao, is the One Way, the Infinite Path which differs for every\n seeker but which, when followed wholeheartedly, takes each unerr-\n ingly to the goal. Dharma is an inborn faculty of existence, not an\n externally derived discipline: 'These activities called dharma are\nimposed as a kind of natural law on all existent beings in the\nuniverse; and a being's initiating of such activity is no moral act\ncontingent on his disposition, but an innate characteristic, that\nwhich makes a being what it is, assigning the part it is to play in\nconcert. It is the dbarma of the Sun to shine, of the pole to be fixed,\nof the rivers to flow, of the cow to yield milk . . .'

As our Jyotish guru once observed, 'Why\nare you Westerners so interested in changing your destiny when it is\nso hard to live up to it?' One of Jyotish's tasks is to teach you what\nyour true dharma is, instead of what your ego desires it to be.

The origins of many house\nmeanings can be grouped into two loose categories: Astronomical\nRealities and Numerical Value of the Houses.\n\n Astronomical Realities\nHouses I through 4 are the foundation houses of the horoscope,\nhouses j through 8 the development houses, and houses 9 through\n1 2 the culmination houses. The last four houses are the epitomes,\nthe peak achievements, of the four Vedic aims of life; this is\nastronomically true of houses 9, 10 and 11, which are the highest\nhouses in the sky, and even the twelfth house is at least still\nascending. While this sort of evaluation is not much used in natal\ninterpretation, it is one way in which the zodiac reflects the progress\nof human endeavor.\n Jyotish's texts call planets which are above the horizon strong\nbecause they are at least theoretically visible and so they can act in a\nmore externalized way than can planets which remain unseen.\nPlanets in kendras are strong because they are in commanding\nregions of the sky, namely on the eastern horizon, overhead, on the\nwestern horizon, and underfoot. The kendras represent the turning\npoints of the sun during the perpetual succession of nights and\ndays. The ascendant represents birth and everything associated with\nbirth, because the sun is born as it rises. Just as when a baby is born",

The first house rules over a\n person's body, characteristics, birth, infancy and youth chiefly be-\n cause the first house is the house being 'born' on the horizon when\n a person is born.\n The Sun is at its peak in the sky in the tenth house, which by\n extension suggests that human activity (specifically, one's career) is\n at its peak in the tenth house. Tenth-house activities are public\n activities which are performed in the bright light of the Sun, as\nopposed to private human activity, which happens predominantly at\nhome, at night, when the Sun is invisible in the fourth house of\nhome. The Sun is not as happy in the fourth house as it is in the\n tenth. The death of the Sun as it sets in the seventh house makes\nthat house a maraka. This principle extends to all the planets: They\nare 'born', or come into visible existence, when they rise in the first\nhouse of a locality; they act most strongly in the tenth; they die in the\nseventh, and they are most private and home-bound in the fourth.\n The rising Sun, which is by definition always in the ascendant, is\nimpressive because of the dramatic contrast it provides between the\ndarkness of the night now past and the promise of light of the day\njust dawning. An hour or two after its rising, however, the Sun is\nno longer so impressive, because that contrast has been lost; it has\nrisen far enough into the sky to be merely a weak Sun, thanks to its\nongoing diurnal motion. This applies to the other planets too, when\nthe constellations in which they sit completely leave the ascendant\nand are replaced there by the next cons'tellation in line. Such planets\nnow occupy the twelfth house of the sky, a house of loss.\n Another house of loss is the eighth house. Often called the\nhouse of longevity, the eighth house represents the impending\nawareness of the end of life for any planet sitting in it, for that\nplanet is retreating from the visible sky as it nears the western\nhorizon and prepares to set. Such planets are always wcak, since\ntheir influence is about to disappear, which means the eighth house\nis almost always an undesirable placement for a planet. The seventh\nhouse is better, because the Sun is now on the horizon engaged in\nsetting. This again enhances the contrast factor, for the mind is",

A\nplanet in the seventh house has accepted its fate and is now\nprepared to die.\n The sixth house, the first segment of the netherworld of the sky,\nis where planets go after setting; it is the Land of Darkness, another\nplace of loss. Since, however, the planet has made its transition from\nvisible to invisible and is now moving toward another angular house,\nthe sixth is also an upachaya house, a house in which things gradu-\nally improve. One reason why the sixth is better than the eighth is\nthat when you are about to die (eighth house) you still have fear,\nbut after you are dead (sixth house) you gradually become accus-\ntomed to,your new state, just as your eyes become accustomed to\nthe lack of light after you enter a dark room. This 'becoming\naccustomed to' is what makes the sixth an upachaya house.\n The second house is a special case. Though houses in similar\npositions in the sky - the sixth and eighth, which are immediately\nabove and below the western horizon, and the twelfth, which is\njust above the eastern horizon - tend to produce undesirable\nresults, the second is the house which is always just about to rise\non the eastern horizon. Because it shows the promise of what is\nto come, the second is classed as a generally good house, rather\non a par with the eleventh. Also, the second house is a maraka\nbecause it indicates something coming to an end: in this case, the end\nof the night. But because the end of the night is the beginning of\nthe day, and since most humans welcome the light of day, the\nsecond house, though parallel in sky position to the eighth, does not\ncarry the eighth's severe connotations, particularly since the planets\nwithin the second house are readying themselves to take birth.",

The first house and the planets which influence it\n indicate the profession you have an inclination or talent for, while\n the tenth house, a kendra like the first, represents the actual\nprofession you pursue.\n The seventh house to any house reflects many of the original\nhouse's meanings. While the third house rules the conscious mind,\nthe ninth represents the wisdom of the higher mind; the tenth is a\nhouse of the public, as is the fourth to some extent. The sixth house\n rules sickness, and the twelfth hospitals and isolation. One reason\n this mirroring effect occurs may be that any planet seven houses\naway from a house aspects that house.\n Sometimes a sort of numerological duplication of a house occurs.\nFor example, because one of the fundamental meanings ascribed to\nthe eighth house is longevity, the number eight is consistently\nassociated in Jyotish with longevity. The eighth house away from\nany house therefore indicates a limitation to the duration of effect of\nthe matters of that house. Counting eight houses from the eighth\nhouse gives us the third house, which becomes a sort of derivative\neighth house. Similarly, since the sixth house is a house of disease,\nthe eleventh house, being the sixth from the sixth, becomes a\nderivative house of disease. The ninth house, being fifth from the\nfifth, likewise becomes a derivative house of children.\n We should also mention here the special circumstance in which\nthe lord of a house is the same number of houses away from that\nhouse as that house is from the lagna. This situation, which is called\nBbauat Bhauam, tends to perpetuate the good or evil results of that\nbhava. For example, when the sixth lord sits in the eleventh house\n(the sixth from the sixth) the native may suffer from one disease\nafter another. Or, when the lord of the fourth house of education\nsits in the seventh house (the fourth from the fourth), the native\nmay well study one subject after another, or obtain one degree after\nanother. This will be particularly true for a Pisces lagna, in which\nthe fourth lord Mercury will be exalted in the seventh house, from\nwhich it will aspect the lagna.\n Since houses 6, 8 and 1 2 from the lagna are bad houses, and all",

    "output": "the rest are basically good, the sixth, eighth, or twelfth house from\nany house often causes trouble to that house. Because the twelfth\nhouse of a horoscope is the house of loss, the twelfth house to any\nhouse indicates the loss or the end of the things that bhava\n indicates. Because the third and eighth houses of a horoscope are\nhouses of longevity, the twelfth house counted from the eighth\nhouse ( = the horoscope's seventh house) and the twelfth from the\nthird house (= the horoscope's second house) become the houses\nof 'loss of longevity', or death. This is another reason why the\nsecond and seventh houses are marakas. Because the third house is\ntwelve houses away from the fourth house, it may represent the end\nof residency or home (which means a move). It might also represent\nthe end of the mother, or the partition of property.\n The sixth house from any house also holds ominous implications\nfor that house. When the fifth lord sits in the tenth house it\noccupies the sixth house away from the house it rules. Normally\nplanets that occupy the tenth house should give good results, since\nthe tenth is a good house; but the lord of a house in the sixth from\nits own house should give bad results. This contradiction can\nusually (but not always) be reconciled by dividing the matters\nindicated by the fifth house into two classes: living beings (like\nchildren) and everything else (like intelligence, or speculation). The\nposition from the lagna (the tenth house = a good house = good\nresults) will tend to predominate for all indications of the fifth\nhouse other than living beings, which means that those things will\ntend to prosper. For living beings, however, the position of the\nhouse lord vis-i-vis the house (tenth house = sixth from fifth =\nbad results) tends to predominate, suggesting difficulty begetting\nprogeny, or problems with those children.\n This applies to all other houses as well. When Jupiter, the lord of\nthe second house for a Scorpio ascendant, occupies the seventh\nhouse (the sixth from the second) there is bound to be initial\ntrouble with cash flow and other non-living second-house matters,\nbut this trouble will dissipate as time passes. Because the second\nhouse also represents one's family, however, the individual may\nhave difficulty with his family, or may leave home early and live far\naway from them.

For a Cancer\nascendant the fifth house is Scorpio, which is ruled by Mars. When\nMars occupies the tenth house, it will be in the sixth from the fifth,\nbut (a) it will tenant its own rashi, and (b) it will aspect the fifth\nbhava as its own bhava. Mars should therefore give good results for\nchildren (a fifth-house matter), unless it is severely afflicted. But\neven an exalted planet with no obvious afflictions which serves as\nthe fifth lord and resides in the tenth house (as Venus can do for a\nGemini ascendant) may be unable to produce a child or may give\nsome difficulty with children, because it sits in the sixth from the\nfifth but does not strengthen the fifth by aspect.\n When the lord of a horoscope's third house occupies the eighth\nhouse, its position is inauspicious both from the lagna and from the\nhouse (since the eighth is the sixth from the third). This position is\ntherefore doubly bad for younger brothers and sisters. A similar\nsituation occurs when the lord of the seventh house tenants either\nthe twelfth house (the sixth from the seventh) or the sixth house\n(the twelfth from the seventh). A desirable placement occurs when\nthe lord of a house occupies good positions both from the house\nand from the lagna, as it does when the lord of the ninth house\nresides in the fifth house, which is the ninth from the ninth (and so\nin this situation is also a case of Bhavat Bhavam).\n All these numerical values for the houses are derivative, calculated\nmeanings which can only be taken so far, lest they become\ncontradictory.",

This reinforcement is further enhanced if\nwe take the violent, accident-prone Ketu to be the co-ruler of Aries.\n Most of the characteristics of Mars also characterize Pitta, the\nimpatient dosha which Mars rules and which is therefore often\npredominant in Arians, particularly because the fiery Sun is exalted\nin the ascendant of an Aries lagna. This dedication to intensity is\ncompounded by the fact that the Sun, a friend of the first-house\n lord, is exalted in the first house as lord of the fifth house. The\nrapid, powerful insight which the fiery Mars and Sun together\ncreate may fuel innate Aries impatience toward those who do not\nshare their rapidity. Unchecked, this impatience may develop into\nfrustration, and then into anger at being held back.\n Mars, the ascendant lord, is exalted in Capricorn, which is the\ntenth house here. The Aries native therefore innately enjoys great\nmotivation and ambition, and tends to pioneer things well. Capri-\ncorn's ruler, Saturn, is debilitated in the first house and, since Mars\nrepresents bursts of energy and Saturn represents stamina, Arians\noften do not strategize well for the longer term. This is why Aries\nnatives often need to be reminded that they will enjoy maximum\nsuccess in life when they slow down and consolidate their gains.\n The fact that Mars, the lord of the lagna, is debilitated in Cancer,\nwhich here is the fourth house of home, militates toward a life lived\naway from one's homeland, and a disinclination to settle down.\nAnother reason why Aries natives are said to roam around like rams\nis that Jupiter is a mutually good friend of Mars, which causes the\nmatters of the houses that Jupiter rules (houses nine and twelve) to\ntend to come to the forefront of an Arian's life.\n The inherent fourth-house weakness in an Aries lagna also pro-\nmotes disagreements with the mother, particularly if the Moon, the\nfourth lord and significator of the mother, is afflicted. The potential\nfor differences with and/or separations from siblings is enhanced\nbecause Mercury, the lord of the third and sixth houses, is the\nenemy of Mars, the significator of the third and sixth houses.

Lunar calendars\n likely predated solar ones, particularly because marking time's pas-\nsage by watching the Moon's movement through the star-sprinkled\nvault of the night sky is easier than following the Sun's motion\nthrough the invisible stars of the blue sky of day. Many ancient\ncultures besides that of India, including those of Babylon, China,\nIsrael and Arabia, incorporated the Moon into their calendars.\n When timing certain events in Jyotish, it is essential to do so in\nthe context of an Indian calendar. While some of modern India's\nmany regional calendars are based on the Sun and others on the\nMoon, almost all employ the five measurements which are collec-\ntively known as the pancbanga ('five limbs'). These measurements -\nthe t~urutfu,tzukshatru, tithi, karanu, and yoga - are central to Jyotish,\nfor they effectively define an Indian calendar. Despite the common\nmisconception that Jyotish is a purely lunar astrology, it was the\nSun's movement which inspired jyotishis to use the twelve rashis,\nthe twelve bhavas, and the time-unit day (vura~za). The Moon's\nmovcmcnt along its path in the heavens inspired the use of the\ntwenty-seven bhus or naksbatras (lunar asterisms).

This makes the lunar\nmonth a sort of mirror image of the solar year.\n Tantric Jyotish contributes yet another important alignment of\nthe solar and lunar cycles in the form of a system of breathing\npatterns called Svarodaya. Like most of Tantric Jyotish's unique\nmethods, Svarodaya, which has been preserved principally by oral\ntransmission from a guru to an initiated disciple, provides some\nfascinating insights into the profundity of Tantric thought; Svaro-\ndaya was disclosed by Lord Shiva, one of India's principal deities,\nto his divine spouse Parvati, intending that she keep it secret. The\ngreat yogi Matsyendra Nath, the first head of the Nath lineage of\nimmortal yogis, took the form of a fish and, listening carefully,\nstealthily absorbed that vidya into himself. He then taught it to his\ndisciple Gorakh Nath, who taught. it to his disciples. Thus, it was\ntransferred era by era, until today.\n Svarodaya's basic principles make use of the difference of effect\nbetween the functioning of the Lunar Nadi (the left nostril) and the\nSolar Nadi (the right nostril). Healthy humans do not normally\nbreathe out of both nostrils simultaneously. Instead, one nostril\nalone breathes at a time, usually for ninety minutes; then the other\nnostril takes over, again for about ninety minutes. Only occasionally,\nparticularly around sunrise and sunset, do both nostrils work\ntogether.\n One of the most fundamental and widespread tenets of the Indian\nworld view is that everything which exists outside the human body\nin the cosmos (the macrocosm) also exists, in altered form, within it\n(the microcosm). This principle, known as the Law of the Macro-\ncosm and Microcosm, is India's statement of the old Hermetic\ndoctrine: 'As above, so below'. Svarodaya implies that, among\nother things, those who know the movements of the Sun, the Moon\nand the other planets can use this knowledge to predict the nature\nof the movement of the breath in their bodies, or in other bodies.\nLikewise the movements of breath in the microcosm can be used to\ndetermine the positions of the planets in the macrocosm.",

The\n nadi, which represents 24 minutes of time (half of one muhurta), is\nalso defined in the J'urya J'iddhanta to be equal to 3 6 0 respirations\n (also called prana), each respiration being defined as the time it takes\n clearly to enunciate ten long syllables.\n 24 minutes of time is 1/60 of a day, and during one day (of\napproximately 24 hours) the entire 360\" of the zodiac pass over the\nhorizon. This same nadi which measures time, breathing and cadence\ntherefore also measures space: one nadi = 1/60 x 360' = 6\" = 360\nminutes of arc. Since one nadi = 360 respirations, one respiration\n(or ten long syllables) covers a distance in the sky equal to one\nminute of arc. By standardizing the internal time-units of recitation\nand breathing in terms of the external time-unit day, the seers of\nold succeeded in transplanting external time into the internal cosmos\nof the jyotishi. Such a 'standardized' jyotishi functions as a sort of\nliving clock whose breathing patterns can be used for divination.\n Modern science creates new words to represent new units of\nmeasurement, and as this new terminology proliferates the awareness\nof how to relate these units together often recedes. Sanskritic\nscience, which concentrates on relationships, prefers to re-use the\nsame word to represent similar units in different contexts.

The number 28 is particularly important here\nbecause the average of the lengths of the synodic month of 29.j\ndays and the sidereal month of 27.3 days is approximately 28.4 days,\na number which is not too far from the jo days of the solar month.\nBecause each of the seven visible planets can own one day of a\nseven-day week, the system of rulerships thus formed can correlate\nthe grahas with the 28 nakshatras. The system of 28 Yogas in\nShripati's Ratnumala, which connects the nakshatras with the days\nof the week to determine auspicious moments for activity, is evi-\ndence of just this sort of astrological thinking.\n The question of how the grahas, the bright gods of the heavens,\ndivided these seven days among themselves is the subject of another\nteaching tale. After the twelve constellations of the zodiac had been\nassigned their lords, the time came to distribute the lordship of the\ndays of the week. The life-giving Sun, the most important body in\nthe heavens, naturally took the first unit, which became Sunday.\nThe Moon accordingly took possession of the next unit, which\nbecame Monday. The two regents then turned their attention to\napportioning the remaining weekdays to their 'followers'. After\npondering over the problem, the Sun and Moon agreed that while\nthe constellations are divisions of space, days are divisions of time.\nDay rulerships were then allocated according to the speed at which\nthe planets move. Based on their averaged rate of daily proper\nmotion, as seen from the Earth, the Moon is the fastest planet,\nfollowed in descending order by Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars,\nJupiter and Saturn.

An interesting comparison exists between this\nsystem and the other system that is commonly used for time\ndivision in Jyotish. Just as the day can be divided into twenty-\nfour hours of sixty minutes each, it is also divisible into sixty nadir\n(which are often called gbatikas) of twenty-four minutes each.\nThese two systems complement each other in the same sort of\nway that the jo tithis of 12' each complement the I 2 rashis of joo\neach.\n The first hora (hour) of each day is ruled by that day's planetary\nruler. Since the day in India is taken to start from sunrise, the first\nhour after sunrise on a Sunday is ruled by the Sun, the first hour\nafter sunrise on a Monday belongs to the Moon, Mars rules Tues-\nday's first hour after sunrise, and so on. After the ruler enjoys his\nhour, the other planets then rule in the sequence of their increasing\naveraged rate of daily proper motion. After each planet has ruled an\nhour, the process begins again from the day lord. Thus on Sunday\nthe order is: Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and\nMars; on Monday it is Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus\nand Mercury; and so on.

The most useful astrological\nprinciple involving the days is this: Each dq's nature is akin to that of\nits ruler. Jupiter infuses Thursday, its day, with many of the qualities\nand rulerships assigned to it in Chapter Two. This makes Thursday\na generally benefic day (since Jupiter is a generally benefic graha), a\nday which is good for prayer, children, money, meeting gurus, and\nall the other things which Jupiter rules. Saturday, the day of Saturn,\nis similarly imbued with Saturn's qualities. This makes it generally\nmalefic in nature, like its ruler, a day that brings delays, obstacles\nand disappointments to almost everyone.\n Although these generic traits are subject to modification by every\nother astrological factor influencing a situation, since Jyotish eter-\nnally strives to reach a holistic reading of reality, this does not make\nthem any less true. Our Jyotish guru said one day, in all seriousness,\n'No wonder everyone in this country gets divorced. They all marry\non Saturday!'

The new and full Moons are analogous to\nsunset and sunrlse, when both nostrils work together.\n The 1st to the 14th tithis of the waxing and waning moon are\nknown by the names of their Sanskrit ordinal numbers, and they are\n\n differentiated by affixing the words sbukla or krisbna respectively to\n the names of the tithis of the waxing and waning cycles. The I j th\n tithi of each series has a special name: that of the waxing cycle is\n called purnima, the full Moon, and that of the waning cycle is\n I\n amavaya, the new Moon. Table 7.2 gives the names of the tithis.",

The nakshatras, which seem to be uniquely Indian in origin,\nseem to have been an important part of 'Vedic' culture, for they\nhave been in continuous use in India since Vedic times. The\nnakshatras are much used in Jyotish even today, particularly in\norder to determine, via electional astrology, the appropriate ritual to\nperform or mantra to recite on a particular day.

One vital use\nfor the nakshatras in natal astrology is in timing the events that a horo-\nscope may promise; this is considered in detail in Chapter Eleven.\n The nakshatras are regarded in Indian mythology as the Moon's\nbrides, for each night the Moon appears to move from the mansion\nof one wife to the next.

When the twenty-\neighth nakshatra, Abhijt, is used, it is inserted between Uttara\nAshadha and Shravana, but its insertion ruins the symmetrical\ndistribution of the nakshatras over the zodiac\ngrahas. Since Jyotish currently uses Abhijit only\nelectional astrology, we do not include it here.\n\nWhen using the principles of Jyotish in interpretation, it is always\nvery important that apples be compared with apples alone, not with\noranges. Once a Westerner approached a seasoned jyotishi to select\nan auspicious date for a marriage. After the jyotishi made his\ncalculations and recommended a date and time, the woman objected,\nfor she had read somewhere that marriage at the end of a month\nis inauspicious. This is in fact quite a common principle in\nJyotish, which assumes that the strength of a juncture-point\n(sandhi) is weakened and ill-defined due to the forced intermingling\nof two differing energies. A sangama (the junction of two rivers) is\nauspicious, because the two energies merge completely on meeting,\nbut a sandhi (literally, a 'joint') is merely a zone of transition\nbetween two energies which retain their own individual charac-\nteristics.\n While most sandhis are inauspicious for worldly matters, because\nthe free flow of prosperity becomes obstructed at such zones of\ntransition, they are often auspicious for certain spiritual endeavors.\nIn this case the jyotishi was forced to point out to the woman\ngently that the time recommended was at the end of a month of\nthe Western calendar, while in the Indian calendar this date fell\nwell within the month's midsection, and so was not a sandhi of\nJyotish.\n The Gandanta ('End-of-the-Cheek') portions of the nakshatras\nform another class of sandhi which Jyotish finds inauspicious.

Although some assert that\n it is possible to know quite a lot about 'Vedic astrology' without\nknowing much about the nakshatras, other eminent jyotishis, includ-\ning our gurus, maintain that nakshatras are among the most impor-\ntant of all the principles in Jyotish; we will t h f o r e pay close\nattention to the nakshatras. Listed below are some elementary but\nrepresentative hints concerning the traditional uses of the nakshatras\nin the interpretation of natal horoscopes. Varahamihira's descrip-\ntions of the Moon's predictions are literal translations from his\nBribud Jutah.\n All problems associated with the body part listed for a nakshatra\nare understood to be ruled by that asterism. Afflictions to a nak-\nshatra (such as when it is occupied by a malefic whose force is not\nattenuated by the influence of any benefic) may create diseases in\nthe part of the body which that nakshatra rules. Such ailments are\noften characterized by the nature of the graha(s) involved. For\nexample, one person with Mars (cutting) in Shravana (the sexual\norgan) underwent surgery on the sexual organ. Another with Mars\n(inflammation) in Ardra (eyes) has had many eye infections. Yet\nanother with Rahu (spasms) in Chitra (the neck) suffers from\nrecurring neck-muscle spasms. While these combinations sometimes\nshow up in isolation, they must usually be read in the context of the\nwhole chart to become evident. At what age a person will experience\nthe anticipated difficulty can be determined only by timing tech-\nniques (see below, Chapter Eleven).\n No encyclopedically comprehensive list of nakshatra meanings\nexists, for they vary in different contexts. After you have digested\nthe material provided and develop a feel for some of the major\nthemes associated with each nakshatra, your own research and\nobservations should enable you to complement this knowledge.

Sharp writing and sewing\nimplements and sharp tools like drills are all ruled by Kr' tika.

Ardra also\n rules diplomacy, people who are critical by nature, cruelty, lawless-\nness, perversity, self-centered attitudes, lying and cheating. When\nthe lagna or the Moon occupies Ardra, the native may have strong\nfeelings which may be overwhelming.\n Planets positioned in Ardra, and the matters indicated by the houses\nthey rule, may be a source of sorrow and disappointment. If Mars, one\nsignificator for siblings, happens to be lord of the third house of\nsiblings (as it is for Virgo and Aquarius lagnas) and happens to occupy\nArdra, the native may have no siblings or may have a difficult\nrelationship with them, or a brother or sister may die or be seriously\ndistressed.

Aditi represents true\nfreedom and plenty, which is the product of an amiable, adaptive,\nunderstanding and reasonable character, one who is capable of\nbeing happy with little when necessary.

Natives of Purva ~halgukitend to be .\n carefree, are disinclined to worry and like to rely on their luck. Such\n attitudes benefit health but foster impetuousness and a lack of\n forethought and planning.

In the divine\n scheme of things, Aryaman rules patronage, favors and kindness,\n and is often invoked jointly with Bhaga, the Aditya who is the\n presiding deity of Purva Phalguni and who is responsible for marital\n love, sensuality, and wealth acquired through personal merit. Purva\n Phalguni and Uttara Phalguni being in many ways similar, their\n general indications are to a great extent interchangeable and comple-\n mentary; even their deities are often worshipped together. Uttara\n Phalguni, through its association with Aryaman, has however an\n additional connotation of eagerness to help others and alleviate\n suffering through kindness and generosity. It also indicates the\n people one approaches for favors and boons, the patronage one is\n likely to receive in life, and one's intimates and very close friends.\n While benefics well placed in this nakshatra may enhance intimate\n relationships, malefics that are poorly placed there will disturb them.\n When Uttara Phalguni is somehow prominent in a birth chart, there\nmay be gain or scandal or both through amorous adventures.

It can indicate either providing or receiving\n protection from some danger or adversity, as well as a capacity for\n subtle, inventive and imaginative design. Many hymns of the Veda\nhonor Indra for his daring deeds, power, fame, glory and praise-\n worthiness, all qualities associated with this nakshatra. When\nJyeshtha connotes gain, it may be through supernatural, occult or\nextraordinary means but, when afflicted, Jyeshtha betokens hard\ntimes and poverty. Saturn in Jyeshtha in, for example, the second\nhouse of money may reflect a decided lack of money, all other\nfactors being equal. Lagna or Moon here often indicates two-faced,\nhypocritical and secretive behavior.\n Jyeshtha means 'the eldest', particularly in social contexts, in\nwhich it represents 'the most important', 'the founder' or 'the\npreferred'.

The Jyeshtha person\nmay be the patriarch or matriarch of a family, the oldest brother,\nsister or child, or possibly a favored paramour.

They have firm and\nfixed opinions, and live in luxury.\nGeneral Indications: Mula's symbol consists of some roots bunched\ntogether and tied. Its deity is Nirriti ('calamity'), the goddess of\ndissolution who personifies evil and corruption and is sometimes\nknown as Alakshmi, the opposite of Lakshmi, the goddess of\nprosperity. Nirriti either directly induces material privation or causes\nprosperity to deteriorate after it is attained.\n Because roots penetrate deep into unseen realms, Mula is associ-\nated with getting to the bottom of things, literally or figuratively,\nby scientific, philosophical and other forms of deep inquiry. Though\nan individual often goes deeply into a matter ruled by a planet\nposited in Mula, that deep inquiry may not yield affluence, particu-\nlarly if the planet is otherwise afflicted, because Nirriti and Mula are\nopposed to abundance. For example, when the lord of the tenth\nhouse of profession occupies Mula, the individual may not prosper\nfrom his profession in a worldly sense, though he may delve deeply\ninto it. The late Martin Luther King, whose horoscope had this\ncombination, was a man whose level of worldly prosperity was not\ncommensurate with his depth of professional achievement. Since\nNirriti connotes opposites, reverses and losses, Mula is associated\nwith contrariness and with borrowing and lending to one's detri-\nment. As such, it is against the rules of electional astrology to lend\nor borrow during Mula, for the debt may go bad or prove to be\nvery vexatious.\n Lagna or Moon in Mula often indicates a skilled and clever\nindividual with good oratorical abilities who can enthrall an audi-\nence. Mula also stands for the unseen origins of visible conditions,\nlike the germs which are the roots of some diseases. Roots are also\nfoundations, beginnings and sources. Roots being much used for\nmedicinal purposes, Mula is associated with medicines. The fact that\nMula's roots are tied adds a certain sense of restraint, bondage\nor limited mobility, all meanings that accompany this nakshatra.",

Its presiding\ndeity is Apah, or water deified as a god.\n Since another name for this nakshatra is Aparajita, 'the Unde-\nfeated', it connotes victory in struggles and confrontations. Purva\nAshadha enables one to be patient, to wait for obstacles or unpleas-\nant circumstances to subside in the way that a fan enables one\npatiently to tolerate uncomfortable heat. Fanning is actually an act\nof aggression on heat, just as winnowing grain is an act of aggression\non the grain. These may be the reasons why Purva Ashadha is also\nassociated with declarations of war and other aggressions. The fan\nand the winnowing basket being implements of culture that improve\nlife and comfort, Purva Ashadha tends to produce strong desires to\nimprove one's circumstances. If the planets activating this nakshatra\nare poorly placed, this often occurs in a self-indulgent way.\n Purva Ashadha strongly suggests invincibility and, when the\nlagna or the Moon appears in this nakshatra, it often indicates a\ngood debater, whose formal education may have been interrupted.\nApah or water is pervasive and universal, two qualities readily\nassociated with Purva Ashadha, which also promotes journeys by\nrivers and seas, sexual excesses, and watery diseases like water\nretention or abnormal kidney or bladder function.\n\nPhysiology e9 Diseases: The thighs; the back portion of the trunk.\nProfessions, People e9 Places: All professions, people and placei\nassociated with water in its various forms: shipping, sailing, navy,\nmarine life, water utilities, etc. People who process raw materials,\nlike manufacturers or refiners.",

Uttara Ashadha (26\" 40' Sagittarius to I oo oo' Capricorn)\n Varahamihira: Whoever has the Moon in Uttara Ashadha will be\nobedient and learned in the rules of virtue, and will be grateful, will\nhave many friends, will return favors received, and will generally be\nliked.\nGeneral Indications: Uttara Ashadha's symbol is the tusk of an el-\nephant, and its deities are the ten Vishvadevas, the sons of the god\nDharma (righteousness) and the Goddess Vishva (universality, the\nall). Their names, in loose translation, are Goodness, Truth, Will-\npower, Skillfulness, Time, Desire, Firmness, Ancestors, Brightness\nand Peak (or Acme), all attributes which are associated with Uttara\nAshadha.\n The qualities of Purva Ashadha also apply to this nakshatra, as\none is the former (purva) part and the other the latter (uttara) part of\nthe same nakshatra. One difference between them is that Uttara\nAshadha is more introspective and possesses greater permanence\nand durability than does Purva Ashadha. It is also less aggressive\nthan its mate. When the lagna or Moon occupies Uttara Ashadha, it\noften indicates honest, sincere people who are respected and valued\nfor their advice and who are inclined to be conciliators.\n The elephant-tusk symbol leads some to associate this nakshatra\nwith Ganesha, the one-tusked elephant-headed god who is invoked\nto bless new beginnings and to remove obstacles from one's path.\nBecause Uttara Ashadha connotes new beginnings and endeavors\nwhich become successful and permanent, this nakshatra when well\nplaced gives its natives a talent for commencing new enterprises and\nthen seeing them through to their natural conclusions. When poorly\nplaced, the native may start new projects helter-skelter, and then fail\nto complete them. An elephant's tusk is sharp, and so can penetrate.",

The circumferential fence\nsimultaneously protects the inner being from any outer danger and\nprevents it from joining the greater whole by segregating it, holding\nit captive. A shoreline confines a body of water in the same way\nthat the horizon, the limit of our vision, encloses the sky.

This asterism also\nrules traps and paralysis, both literal and symbolic. The empty circle\nmay also indicate 'zero', a sophisticated mathematical concept which\nis used in some philosophical systems to indicate the Void behind\nall creation.

Also, while detrimental actions are actually\ncarried out by those who are strongly influenced by Purva Bhadra-\npada, Uttara Bhadrapada displays greater restraint, and planned evil\nactions are usually controlled or sublimated.

Here are a few broad hints for using nakshatra material\neffectively when examining a natal horoscope:\n Nakshatras, when well placed, display their more positive\n indications and, when afflicted, display their more negative\n indications. For example, if Revati is afflicted, its indications of\n safe travel will be greatly reduced, whereas if it is well placed,\n those same indications will be greatly enhanced.\n Nakshatras are well placed if occupied by a natural benefic, and\n are exceptionally well placed if this tenanting benefic is conjoined\n with or aspected by. another natural benefic.\n\n Nakshatras are afflicted if occupied by a natural malefic, and are\n exceptionally afflicted if this tenanting malefic is conjoined with\n or aspected by another natural malefic.\n\nWhen the ruler of a nakshatra occupies a kendra or a kona or its\n own daksh'atr; or rashi or its exaltation rashi, that nakshatra is\n well placed.

'If Saturn is in Libra the person\n will be famous, will be the head of his clan, a leader of a town,\ncommander of a force or the headman of a village, and will be\n wealthy.' These two observations, made by Varahamihira in Chapter\n I 8 of his Brihad Jataka, are uncomplicated examples of the type of\n interpretive statements called grahayogas ('planetary combinations').\n Simple graha yogas (which differ from the soli-lunar yogas of the\nPanchanga given above) involve only one or two astrological factors,\nsuch as the effects of each planet occupying each of the constellations\nand each of the houses, or the effects of the various planets when\nassociated with or aspected by other planets. The classical works on\nJyotish, in which graha yogas abound, unfortunately synthesize\nneither the various possible combinations that can result from a\nplanet's position by house, by constellation and by the aspects it\nreceives, nor the complex web of relationships that the astrological\nfactors spin when concepts more advanced than graha, rashi, bhava\nand aspect are factored into the interpretation.\n As a result, though the textually described effects of particular\nplanetary positions in a horoscope are sometimes dramatically cor-\nrect, at other times they land far from the mark. This is only to be\nexpected, since every person born on Earth during the two and a\nhalf years that Saturn sits in Aries is not a friendless, deceitful fool,\nnor is everyone born during Saturn's thirty-month sojourn in Libra\na famous, wealthy ruler. Clearly, further principles of differentiation\nare necessary for simple graha yogas if they are to have any utility.\n One solution to this problem 'is to create more complex graha\n\n I N T E R P R E T A T I O N O F T H E H O R O S C O P E 249",

Look at this example from Chapter 16 of Phaladipika: 'If at\n birth the lord of the fourth house as well as the Moon occupy the\n sixth, the eighth or the twelfth house, and be without the association\n or aspect of benefic planets, and be also conjoined with or aspected\n by maletic planets, and/or have malefic planets flanking it, the result\nwould be the death of the mother. But should the above two\n planets be strong and associated with or aspected by benefic planets,\nand if benefic planets occupy the fourth house, the planetary combi-\nnation will be conducive to the happiness of the mother.'\n Literally thousands of such statements pack the authoritative\ntexts on Jyotish in Sanskrit. Their number and complexity require a\nphenomenal memory, and colossal awareness, for their effective\nimplementation. Because any given horoscope commonly has but a\nfew of these elaborate combinations, it is neither practical nor\nproductive mechanically to catalogue and literally interpret them;\nwhen contradictory combinations which are not reconciled by the\ntexts also exist in the same horoscope, the jyotishi may be in a\ndilemma over which interpretation to apply. No amount of bookish\nstudy can teach a student how to reconcile all these multifarious\ninfluences, any more than any other art can be learnt from a book.\nBooks can provide only information; the reader must learn how to\njudge the many factors which do not admit of easy quantification,\nsuch as the fact that Saturn is such an important graha that, even\nwhen debilitated, it does not become completely without energy.\n While it is certainly desirable, despite these difficulties, to become\nfamiliar with the multitude of graha yogas stored in the various\ntexts, it is perhaps even more profitable to understand the principles\nof interpretation which underlie them. With good comprehension,\nand after mature reflection and experience, a good jyotishi can\ncreate a multitude of combinations and predict their potential\neffects. When, for example, you understand that malefic grahas\nobstruct the indications of the houses they contact, and that a\nconfluence of similar factors will guarantee such obstruction, you\ncan then create the statement that three or more malefics aspecting\nthe ascendant will create health problems (since the first house\nrepresents a person's physical well-being), or that three or more",

The horo-\n scope's bhavas are the arenas of life in which one performs karmas.\n Because humans perform their karmas mainly via mind, speech and\n activities, malefics affecting the second, the fifth or the tenth bhavas\n of a horoscope tend to cause people to get themselves into trouble\n through their speech, their thoughts, or their activities respectively.\n All the rules presented in texts cannot be taken at face value.\n Varahamihira, for example, describes the effects of Mercury when it\n sits in the fourth, seventh or tenth houses from the Sun, positions\nwhich are astronomically impossible.

The confluence of\npredominantly good or bad indications gives the jyotishi an idea of\nwhat to predict. If equal testimonies for good and bad indications\n exist, jyotishis pray for guidance before using their experience and\nintuition to render a judicious judgement. Results are often more\npredictable in a very narrow domain than in a broader field which\ninvolves more variables.\n While looking for confluence, remember that life is usually not\nan all-or-nothing matter, and Jyotish, which tries to be a reliable\nmodel of life, tries to reflect this. Good and bad indications in a\nhoroscope usually do not cancel each other; if a house shows very\ngood results, the lord of the house shows very bad results and the\nsignificator shows neutral results, then both good and bad results\nwill happen. If such conditions apply in a horoscope to the fifth\nhouse, which predominantly indicates children, the person may\nhave beautiful children in whom they delight, but may also suffer\nthe heartbreak of losing a child. If, on the other hand, both the fifth\nbhava and its lord indicate good results and the karaka indicates bad\nones, then only the occasional fly will disturb the otherwise pleasing\nointment of one's children.\n Remember that these principles are abstractions which gain form\nand substance only from your own personal experience. It is one\nthing to say to a person whose horoscope you are interpreting, 'There\nwill be both happiness and unhappiness pertaining to children,' and it\nis quite another to say, 'One of your children may cause you great\nconcern on account of a marked tendency to ill-health, but your other\ntwo kids will most likely be healthy, highly educated, and respected in\ntheir professions.' It is something else entirely to grasp the confluence\nof factors well enough to be able confidently to apply upaya\n(remedies), Jyotish's 'phantom limb', and to recommend strategies to\nmodify or preven* the possibility of ill-health to the child in question.\n While searching for confluence, be sure to limit yourself to the\nprinciples of Jyotish.

Here he states clearly that lordship is\nmore important, and that a malefic which aspects or occupies its\nown bhava is bound to give good results for that bhava. Since in\nthis horoscope Saturn, a natural malefic, aspects the sixth house,\nwhere lies Aquarius, one of the two constellations that Saturn rules,\nthe sixth house is bound to be benefited thereby.\n '. . . This good effect of the houses will be certain if the planets involved\nare strong, that is, not in their debilitation constellation, not combust and\nnot in the constellation of their enemy.'\nThis is the last criterion to be applied to determine whether or not a\nbhava will produce exclusively good effects. Even if all the above\nconditions are fulfilled, good results become certain only if the\nplanets involved are strong, as specified here. Since in Chart z none\nof the planets that favorably influence the second house (Venus and\nMercury) or the eighth house (Venus, Mercury and Jupiter) is\ndebilitated, combust or in the constellation of an enemy, we are\ncompelled to conclude that in this horoscope Mantreshwara's prin-\nciple applies in toto to the second and eighth bhavas, so we must\npredict these houses to give desirable results in abundance.\n The native is in fact a millionaire who sings and speaks well, has\na handsome face and good eyes, deals in precious gems, is fascinated\nby and supports classical lore, and enjoys the comforts of a close-\nknit extended family (all these being primary second-house mean-\nings).

For example, to estimate the\nexperience of birth, infancy and youth, the first house, the lord of\nthe first house, and the bhava karaka of the first house (which in\nthis context will always be the Sun) must be analyzed.\n Mantreshwara's verses provide us with the criteria we need to\nestablish whether or not a bhava, its lord or its significator is\ndevoid of strength.

When Venus, the lord of the eighth\nhouse for a Pisces ascendant, is exalted, it occupies the lagna, which\nmay in some cases greatly impair the native's physical well-being\n(based on principle 9, above). All the auspicious indications of\ndebilitated planets are disturbed, and all their inauspicious\ntions are enhanced.\nI j. A planet which is situated in a rashi owned by a natural benefic\nwhich is its friend will produce results that are more pleasant or\ntolerable than will a planet situated in a rashi owned by a natural\nbenefic which is its enemy. A planet which is situated in a rashi\nowned by a natural malefic which is its enemy will produce\nresults that are less tolerable than will a planet situated in a rashi\nowned by a natural malefic which is its friend.\n14. Planets who are mutual friends will, when participating together\nin a desirable horoscopic combination, cooperate together to en-\nhance beneficial results or to reduce detrimental results.

A planet or a house is strengthened when it is flanked on both\nsides by constellations containing natural benefics, and a planet or a\nhouse is weakened when it is flanked (hemmed in) on both sides by\nconstellations containing natural malefics.

When the lord of one house aspects or occupies another house,\nthe meanings of those two houses usually become blended. Some-\ntimes the aspecting or occupying lord becomes the cause for the ef-\nfect promised by the house that is aspected or occupied.

Exalted grahas and those in their own rashis display\ntheir prowess freely, while debilitated or otherwise weak grahas\ncannot unobstructedly display the energy they possess. A graha's\nenergy, weak or strong, can promote either a peaceful, fulfilling life\nor a life disrupted by confrontation, depending on the natural\nbenefic or malefic natures of the graha itself and the grahas that\ninfluence it, and on the houses that graha rules in the horoscope.\n One of the most significant ways in which one graha can influence\nanother in a horoscope is by acting as its dispositor, the lord of the\nrashi in which it sits. In Nadi Jyotish a graha is said to possess both a\ndeha (body) and ajiva (soul). This theory has gradually metamorphosed\nto mean, in the context of a bhava, that the graha itself is only the\nbody, while the graha's dispositor represents its soul. According to\nthis approach, one should never simply judge an individual (graha) by\nits body alone but should also consider its soul, which is in many ways\nmore significant than its body. An ugly body tenanted by a beautiful\nsoul will eventually attract the attention of those others who so value\nthat soul that they will ignore its misshapen vessel; but an ugly soul in\na beautiful body will eventually cause others to flee from it in disgust.",

    "output": "The dispositor principle is one of the bases on which Jyotish\nstands. One portion of Mantreshwara's verse that is quoted above\nreads: 'All bhavas will give rise to exclusively good results if\noccupied or aspected by . . . their own lords.' When the lord ~f a\nhouse supports (by occupation or aspect) his own house, the soul in\neffect invigorates, protects and directs the body, and whenever\nbody and soul work together harmoniously success is certain, for\nindividual grahas, or. humans. A bhava is a state of being or\nconsciousness, and every graha takes on the state of being of the\nbhava it occupies. When therefore the soul of a house is tormented\n(by malefics, debilitation and the like), the bhava itself is bound to be\ntormented (because the body is secondary to, and dependent upon,\nthe soul), and any graha therein will share in the torment.\n It is particularly useful when trying to understand this thorny\nmatter to think of the grahas in anthropomorphic forms. Indian\nphilosophy recognizes two fundamental types of humans: those\nwho are straightforward (rjtc) and those whose are crooked (kutila).\nBenefics resemble the straightforward, those people who are funda-\nmentally good at heart, who try to follow the laws of the land and\nto live unselfishly. Malefics resemble the crooked, self-centered\npeople of society. Just as someone who is a crook by nature will\nalways do things the illegal way if he has the choice, a malefic\nalways tends to cause some difficulties, no matter what other sorts\nof benefits he may promise.\n Being straightforward, benefics are relatively predictable: a debili-\ntated benefic is weak, and an exalted benefic powerful. Exalted\nbenefics are strong, and have strength of character. Though debili-\ntated benefics try to be strong, they have weak personalities; when\nput under stress, their morality tends to crumble and they may\nbegin to behave like malefics. Stress arises from bad placement: the\naspect of or conjunction with malefics, occupation of the trik\nhouses, bad avasthas, and so on.\n Being crooked, malefics are less predictable. An exalted malefic is\na sort of elegant rogue, an iron fist in a velvet glove. Should this\nrogue be exposed to the influence of good people (satsanga), as he\nwould be when aspected by or conjunct with benefics, his tendency\nto give good results will certainly be enhanced; still, on occasion,",

A\n debilitated malefic on the other hand is a truly low-life sort of\n being, and when this thug is egged on by other malefics (by aspect,\n conjunction and the like) he will display destructive tendencies at all\n times. An exalted malefic, whose strength gives him a sense of\n security, feels he can afford to act more or less benignly; but\n debilitated malefics, who are low in self-esteem, lash out at everyone\nand cause lots of trouble, sometimes destroying in a matter of\nmoments things which may have taken much time, energy and care\n to build.\n A natural malefic when weak needs only to remove the supports\nwhich are propping up certain areas of life to have them come\ncrashing down on the native's head; it need not attack the poor soul\ndirectly to wreak havoc. When the lord of the eighth house is\ndebilitated, for example, it will both reduce the native's longevity\nand increase the likelihood of accidents, so that when the native is\nin dire need of just a little bit of survival luck, that luck may be\ndenied. Should that debilitated malefic be somehow strengthened -\nby being retrograde, having directional strength, being involved in\na good yoga (like Parivartana Yoga; see Chapter Ten), being\nvargottama, having a good avastha, and so on - its good indications\n(by house rulership) will be enhanced, but its bad indications may\nnot be reduced.\n A debilitated graha may also obtain some energy from its disposi-\ntor if that dispositor is strong, and this may curtail its reign of\nterror. But when a debilitated graha's dispositor is itself debilitated,\none must predict the worst sorts of results, because that graha will\nbe tortured body and soul. Exalted grahas are much more likely to\ngive good results when their dispositors are exalted or otherwise\nstrong than when those dispositors are weak; when an exalted\ngraha's dispositor is debilitated, none of the good promised by that\nexaltation is likely to pan out, since there is nothing to back it up.\nAn exalted Jupiter (in Cancer) in a horoscope where its dispositor\nthe Moon is debilitated in Scorpio would be considerably weakened;\nthe same would happen to a Saturn in Libra if Venus tenanted\nVirgo.",

All are central to interpretation, and\nall are frequently misunderstood.\nCombustion - Combust planets move so close to the Sun that they\nbecome invisible to us. Being thus eclipsed, and because when\ncombust they are farthest from the earth (using the analogy, which\nis not necessarily causative, of an object becoming less able to\ninfluence another object the further it recedes from that other\nobject), the jyotishis of India concluded that the influence of com-\nbust planets becomes exceedingly weak, particularly regarding the\nhouses they own. Mercury, which cannot be further than one rashi\nfrom the Sun, is frequently combust, and perceptible problems\noften afflict the houses a combust Mercury rules in a birth chart.\n One useful rule for interpreting combustion is that while the\nexternalixed meanings (including the various bod3,parts) of a house are often\ndamaged when the ruler of that house is combust, the inner meanings\n(including particular4 the pychic or mental functions) are usual4 not\nspoiled. On the contrary, when the Sun, who represents the soul,\ncomes into contact with a planet, the inner or astral qualities of that\ngraha will become illumined and enlivened. Sun + Mercury often\ncauses the native to become intellectually brilliant (see Budhaditya\nYoga in the next chapter), and Sun + Venus tends to enliven the\nquality of beauty. How these results materialize will of course\ndepend on the various other influences that affect such combina-\ntions, for every person with Sun conjunct Mercury does not enjoy a\nlively intellect.\n The external qualities of the planets differ from person to person\naccording to their natural significations and the houses they control.\nJupiter, for example, rules the seventh and tenth houses in a Gemini\nascendant.

Because Jupiter is also the natural significator\n of children, which form another external object of an individual's\n experience, the native's children may also be affected by the combus-\n tion. Jupiter's inner qualities (like generosity, wisdom, love of\n knowledge, and intuition) may however become more apparent in\nsuch a person, enlivened by the proximity of the Sun.\n Natural benefics when combust lose ability to influence benefi-\n cently, proportionate to the closeness of the combustion. Natural\nmalefics when combust gain ability to influence maleficently, propor-\ntionate to the closeness of the combustion. While the implications\nof combustion may seem harsh, remember that many of Jyotish's\nprecepts display quite different effects in different contexts, so much\nso that sometimes the detrimental effect of combustion on certain\nhouse meanings may be desirable. A person whose sixth lord is\ncombust may under certain circumstances have very weak enemies.\nOr, when the indicators for brothers and sisters are combust in the\nhoroscope of someone who is disputing with his siblings over a will,\nthe combustion will both suggest the problems with the siblings and\nweaken the ability of those siblings to pursue their lawsuit.\n The closer a planet is to the Sun, the more severely combust it is,\nand the more severe its results will be. Also, keep in mind that a\nplanet is weaker when approaching its exact conjunction with the\nSun than it is when leaving that conjunction. A combust planet\nwhich also occupies its own rashi or is vargottama or exalted is\ncertainly better off than is a combust planet which is debilitated or\nin an enemy's rashi. One very important exception to the implication\nof combustion occurs when the Sun signifies great prosperity in a\nchart. What would be combustion in another horoscope would then\nbecome a planetary combination indicating affluence in one area of\nlife or another. Table 9.1 gives the range of degrees within which a\nplanet is combust.\nRetrogression - Remember that Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and\nSaturn sometimes appear to move backwards against the back-\nground of the fixed stars. This seeming backward movement is\nretrogression. While combust planets are farthest from Earth, retro-",

Such\n a planet can still give some desirable results if it owns good houses,\n though these good results will be less than if it were retrograde and\n exalted. A debilitated and retrograde planet which owns bad houses\n is likely to give adverse results. Phaladipika states that a debilitated\n but retrograde planet is equivalent to an exalted planet, a statement\nwhich is often misunderstood to be literal truth. Our Jyotish guru\n taught us that Mantreshwara may have meant this to illustrate that\n retrograde planets, while strong (like exalted planets), still need to\nbe evaluated in the overall context of the entire horoscope. This\n seems to be borne out by experience.\n Mantreshwara also says that exalted planets when retrograde act\n like debilitated planets, which is likely to be a cautionary statement\n for situations like this one: a retrograde malefic who owns detrimen-\n tal houses may create detrimental results even when exalted because\nof the cumulative results due to the combination of exaltation and\n retrogression. That Mantreshwara's statement is not true of all\nretrograde exalted planets becomes clear when we examine the\nhoroscope of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (see Chapter Twelve).\nLike other texts written to be taught by a guru who would elucidate\nmatters for the student, Phaladipika often does not bother to make\nclear, unambiguous statements. Because this sort of interpretation\ncan be had only from a guru, try as the uninitiated may to guess the\nmeaning of such passages they will never be able to do so, for they\nlack that interpretive guide which the guru holds.\nAvasthas - The avasthas introduced in Chapter Four are secondary\nsources of meaning which temper interpretations rather than reverse\nthem. Take Parashara's statement that planets in Mrita Avastha (the\nlast 6\" of an odd-numbered rashi or the first 6\" of an even-numbered\nrashi) impair the benefic results of its benefic combinations. A\nplanet in Mrita Avastha which is otherwise very strong (as by being\nexalted or in its own rashi) is severely weakened, no doubt, but is\nstill better placed than a debilitated planet in Mrita Avastha.",

But an exalted Venus who occupies the\nfifth house of a Scorpio lagna in the early degrees of Pisces (and so\nin Mrita Avastha) may indicate, rather than the literal death of a\nchild, that the native may treat his children 'as if dead' - disown\nthem, keep them at a distance, live at a great distance from them, or\nthe like. A Mercury exalted in Virgo in the fifth house of a Taurus\nlagna but in Bala Avastha may create a formidable intelligence\nwhich is, however, rather exuberant and untempered by experience,\nsince children and infants are not very experienced.\n Keep in mind when evaluating avasthas that sometimes a planet\nat the very beginning or end of a constellation may be in its\nvargottama navamsha, which will greatly modify its condition of being\neither in Mrita Avastha or in Bala Avastha (the first 6\" of an odd-\nnumbered rashi or the last 6\" of an even-numbered rashi). Although\na Saturn at the tail end of Virgo (between 26\" 40' and 30°) is in Bala\nAvastha, a position of weakness, it occupies Virgo in the navamsha\nas well, a position of strength which cancels and would sometimes\noverride the avastha position.\n To introduce yet another complexity, the star Spica, the yogatara\n(principal star) of Chitra nakshatra, is located at approximately\nz9\" 19' of Virgo (according to Lahiri). Spica is regarded, in both the\nEast and the West, as one of the most auspicious stars in the zodiac.\nSince Jyotish regards as good the conjunction of a planet with a\nfixed star (particularly if within an orb of one degree), the conjunc-\ntion of Saturn with this most auspicious star also overrides its being\nin Bala Avastha.

The balance of this book will build on these\nfundamentals by adding additional methods that can help smooth\nthe way to more difficult judgements.\n With the help of these principles you can confidently conclude\nthat when all the three factors - house, house lord and significator -\nunder consideration for a particular matter are strong in a horoscope,\nthey will enhance that matter. Similarly, when all three factors are\nweak, the corresponding matter will be weakened, which will create\nsome problem or difficulty.

When Jupiter sits in the first\nhouse, he aspects the ninth and the fifth houses, which are respec-\ntively the houses of higher education and children, in the capacity\nof a natural benefic. This is a good influence, again according to\nboth Principles I and 5 , and, since three principles of interpretation\nlead to the same result, this is a case of good confluence.\n To summarize the effects of grahas in bhavas:\n take the graha as a benefic or malefic, and combine its benefic or\n malefic impact with the meanings of the house it occupies; and\n take the graha as agraha karata, and combine its significations\n with the auspicious and/or inauspicious nature of the house it\n occupies.\nIn this way you can compose many more statements concerning the\neffects of planets in houses.

While Venus as a natural benefic\nin the lagna should protect the body (Principle I), Principle 16\nwarns us that someone whose eighth lord of accidents is extremely\nstrongly placed in the first house of the body may experience\nserious accidents. This enigma is resolved by noting that, while\naccidents are likely to occur (the objective level), the native is not\nlikely to be disheartened by them (the subjective level).\n To practice further the principles advanced thus far, start a\ncollection of horoscopes which are notable in some respect, e.g.\nhoroscopes from people who are talented musicians, or who are",

A single word from a teacher discussing horoscope analysis\norally with a small group of students is the equivalent of a thousand\nwritten words, for a good teacher slants the information to accommo-\ndate each student's conceptual background. When Jyotish is taught\nin the traditional Indian context, where teacher and disciple get to\nknow each other over a period of time, they come to speak a\ncommon language, as the student gradually learns the teacher's\nmode of expression. So it was that one day, after five years of\nintense association, our Jyotish guru said to one of us: 'Finally you\nare able to understand my ways, and now you will be able to\nunderstand what I am trying to teach you.'\n Once you begin to understand your guru, knowledge begins to\nflow freely, and as soon as you learn a new principle it will often be\ndemonstrated for you, immediately add automatically. For example,\nafter one of us was told one day by our Jyotish guru that Saturn in\nSagittarius gives problems with the right leg, the next half-dozen\npeople whose horoscopes he read had Saturn in Sagittarius and also\nhad problems with their right legs. Since Saturn stays in Sagittarius\nfor two and a half years at a time, it is obvious that not all of the\nmillions of people born with this combination will have right-leg\nproblems, and this is very much the point: the Jyotir Vidya directs",

At such moments this quotation from the Bhagauad\n Gita (I 8:37-9) may inspire you:\n\nthat joy which is like poison at first and like nectar at the end, which\nsprings from a clear understanding of the Self, is said to be Sattvic. That\njoy which arises from the contact of the senses and their objects, and which\nis like nectar at first but like poison in the end, is said to be Rajasic. That\nhappiness which deludes the soul both at the beginning and at the end, and\nwhich arises from sleep, sloth and negligence, is said to be Tamasic.\n\nSubstitute 'knowledge' for 'joy' in the above quotation and you will\nrealize that the pain and difficulty you experience as you begin to\nwork with horoscopes will lead to the long-term Sattvic joy of\nfluent interpretation.

    "output": "The novice astrologer's greatest problem is how to synthesize\nseveral astrological factors. Neophyte jyotishis tend to take one\nsymbol and, because it is manageable, work it to death. One\nexample is to take Jupiter as a benefic, and to wax eloquent\nconcerning its wonderful effect over everything it influences in the\nhoroscope. While in certain horoscopes this may well be the case,\nsuch a blanket interpretation ignores the possibility that Jupiter, in\nthe chart under consideration, may be disadvantaged in some way.\nA Jupiter which is debilitated, rules bad houses, occupies a detrimen-\ntal house, is aspected by Mars and Saturn, and is associated with\nRahu will often create results quite the opposite of wonderful.\nThough such undesirable effects may build character, most people\nwould nevertheless prefer to avoid them.\n Classical textbooks on Jyotish try to avoid this difficulty by\nforcing the novice from the very start to work with those compli-\ncated combinations called graha yogas. This approach cultivates the\nnecessary and constructive habit of taking many influences into\nconsideration when coming to an astrological conclusion. While its\ninitial intricacy may easily discourage students, a little discourage-\nment can actually be healthy, as long as it does not deepen into\ndespondency. Healthy discouragement eliminates overconfidence\nand engenders humility and circumspection. Good Indian gurus\nregularly discourage their disciples as one method of ego control.\n The general rules underlying graha yogas apply equally to planets\nin houses, to planets in constellations, and to planets that combine\nwith each other. Let us return to the graha yoga mentioned at the\nbeginning of Chapter Nine. Saturn as a malefic posited in Aries will\nclearly influence adversely the various matters ruled by Aries. Since",

Saturn being debilitated in\nAries as the natural significator of subordinates, the person may\nalso experience great difficulty with underlings; being the natural\nindicator of nerves, a debilitated Saturn may create symptoms like\nnervousness and irritability, and so on.\n Now consider how the qualities of Saturn may blend into the\nqualities of Aries. Varahamihira dubs the person with Saturn in\nAries 'a fool' on account of the natural malefic Saturn occupying\nthe constellation which represents the brain; 'deceitful', because a\nfallen Saturn displays its worst qualities; 'always on his legs',\nbecause Saturn rules Capricorn and Aquarius, the constellations\nwhich indicate the legs, so that a weak Saturn will be detrimental to\nthe legs; and 'without friends', because Saturn rules the eleventh\nhouse of the natural zodiac and as such cannot give good friends\nwhen he is debilitated.\n Similar rules of interpretation apply for planets in combination\nwith one another. When Mercury is associated with or aspected by\nMars, all matters ruled by Mercury will be weakened, because Mars\nis a malefic; because Mercury rules speech, such a person may well\nspeak badly, or tell lies. On the other hand, the things which Mars\nrepresents will be blended in with Mercurial matters. Since Mars\nrules aggression and fighting, and Mercury rules great dexterity and\nnimbleness, several works on Jyotish suggest that a Mercury-Mars\nassociation indicates a potential boxer. Mars and Mercury combined\nin the second house are likely to affect the individual's speaking\nability, which both the second house and Mercury rule. Some\ntraditional astrological works suggest that such a combination will\nindicate a logician who is skilled in debate. Since the second house\nrelates more to speaking than to athletics, this seems a more logical\nindication than boxing.\n But suppose this association of Mars and Mercury takes place in\nthe second house in the constellation of Cancer, where Mars is\ndebilitated and Mercury is in the constellation of its enemy. Such a\nnative is less likely to be a great logician and debater than an\nimpulsive and illogical speaker whose hasty words cause antagonism.",

Similarly, Jupiter (who rules\noratory) in the second house in the first half of Sagittarius (a\nconstellation of voice) will indicate through confluence a far better\nspeaker than would Saturn (a mute planet) in the second house in\nPisces (a mute constellation).\n Only a combination of experience and intuition can establish\nwhether a Mercury-Mars combination will make the owner of the\nhoroscope a poor speaker, a great debater, a liar and cheat, a karate\nexpert, or all of them wrapped into one. The key to deciding which\nline of interpretation to follow in any particular instance lies in\nevaluating all factors of the combination simultaneously: the house\nand constellation in which the combination lies, the natures and\nrulerships of the grahas that compose it, the effect of other grahas\non the combination, and the native's environment and cultural\ncontext.\n While this style of interpretation is relatively straightforward in\ntheory, it becomes very involved in practice. Mistakes occur because\nit is not always humanly possible to consider every pertinent\ninfluence in the chart. The seers who gave us Jyotish tried to\nsimplify things for us by emphasizing graha yogas. While thus far\nwe have used the term 'graha yoga' to refer generically to the\ncombination of two or more grahas in a house, from now on we\nwill use it to refer to outstanding planetary combinations which\nindicate specific results. A few of the many classes of such yogas are\nRaja Yogas (which indicate leadership, power and fame); Dbana\nYogas (which suggest wealth) and Daridra Yogas (which promise\npoverty); Pravraa Yogas (which lead to renunciation of the world);\nand Balarisbta Yogas (which indicate death in childhood).\n Many of these yogas are well known to most jyotishis, who often\nlook for them on first glancing at a horoscope. Some jyotishis even\nfocus exclusively on these yogas, and on the indications given for\nthem in the traditional texts, for the more auspicious yogas there are\nin a horoscope, the more likely it will be for the person to become\nsomeone of note who will rise through life to be ~owerfuland",

Another reason is that the grahas\ninvolved in the yogas may be weak (because of combustion, place-\nment in unfriendly rashis or inauspicious avasthas, or weakness in\n subcharts). Yet another reason is that under certain circumstances,\nwhich are described at the end of this chapter, a horoscope's\nbenevolent yogas can be canceled or broken (in Sanskrit bbanga).\n Except when noted, graha yogas are calculated from the ascend-\nant. Jyotishis often seek confirmation of a combination shown from\nthe ascendant by reading the horoscope from the constellation\noccupied by the Moon, using the latter as if it were the ascendant,\nsince after the ascendant the Moon is the fastest-moving factor in a\nhoroscope. This sort of 'tying down' of the chart is the Cbandra\nLagna (Moon Lagna), which is frequently used when the birthtime\nis very imprecise. When known, however, the ascendant is always\npre-eminent. Many graha yogas can be counted either from the\nMoon (Cbandra Yogas) or from the ascendant (Lagna Yogas) and, on\noccasion, also from the Sun lagna (Swya Lagna).\n Every student of Jyotish should practice locating the several\ngraha yogas below in many horoscopes in order to be able to\nrecognize them readily, and to get a headstart on understanding\nJyotish's many other yogas.

A Ruchaka Yoga,\nfor example, is one thing when Mars is aspected by its friend\nJupiter alone, and quite another when it is aspected by its enemy\nSaturn, and is conjoined with Rahu.\n Note that the indications for these yogas are mainly the significa-\ntions for the grahas involved, because a Pancha Mahapurusha\nYoga allows a graha to express its inherent nature freely and\nstrongly. The description of Ruchaka Yoga is clearly a glorified\nlisting of the astrological attributes of Mars. Mantreshwara might\nas well have gone on to say that someone with Ruchaka Yoga\nwill be fond of confrontations, will be a 'victory-at-any-cost' com-\npetitor, may be accident-prone, will serve in executive and inde-\npendent positions, may be a crusader for various causes, may have\npowerful younger siblings, may be athletic, may be a lawyer, and\nSO on.\n Many people with strong Ruchaka Yogas do end up becoming\nlawyers, but this potential will be actualized only in those horoscopes\ni.. which the fourth house of education (because law requires formal\neducation) and Jupiter (because law requires good judgement) are\nboth strong.

Chart 2's owner does indeed live on a property with a pond,\nand very much enjoys amusements. The same text also states that\nsuch an individual will have full cheeks and a round forehead, two\ncharacteristics which this person does possess.\n Simply because a graha occupies its own or its exaltation constella-\ntion does not create a Pancha Mahapurusha Yoga. Venus, which\noccupies Libra in Chart 2, is conjoined with the benefic Mercury.\nThis is an auspicious placement, but it is no Malavya Yoga because\nit sits in the second house, which is neither a kendra nor a kona.\nLikewise, in Chart I (see p. 41)) Jupiter is exalted but is in the\nsecond house, so that no Hamsa Yoga is formed.

Whenever Napoleon was considering\n elevating one of his generals to the rank of marshal, his final\n question, after hearing a litany of the man's achievements and\n qualifications, would reportedly be: 'Yes, but is he lucky?'\n Dharma Karma Adhipati Yogas are examples of Raja Yogas,\ncombinations which promise success, wealth, influence and celebrity.\nA strong Dharma Karma Adhipati Yoga enables a person to rise to\na position of great prominence in society. Although, technically\nspeaking, a Raja Yoga is a combination for political success (a raja\n is a ruler), over the years it has come to promise success, wealth,\ninfluence and/or celebrity. While in the old days the king had the\npower to support and influence all others, today non-political\npeople like writers, actors, musicians and media moguls are often\nmore influential, wealthy and famous than most of our rulers.\n The source of good fortune is the Law of Karma: The total of\nyour past karmas determines what sort of assistance the world will\ngive you.

It is sometimes said that Mars forms Raja Yoga for a\nCancer ascendant only when it is supported by benefics.\n Saturn acts as Raja Yoga Karaka for the ascendants of Venus,\nand Venus returns the favor for Saturn.

There is a drawback in Chart 2 in the aspect of the malefic\nMars, who also owns the eighth house, on the Jupiter-Saturn\ncombination, but this, as your experience will eventually enable you\nto conclude, is a minor blemish on an otherwise strong yoga. Some\nslight imperfection always occurs, alas, in even the best of horo-\nscopes; such is the nature of embodied life.\n We must also examine a Dharma Karma Adhipati Yoga from the\nMoon and Sun Lagnas. Recall the five human bodies, the annamayako-\nsha (physical body), pranamayakosha (etheric body), manomayakosha\n(subtle body), uijnanamqakosha (causal body) and anandamayakosha\n(greater causal body). The ascendant (Birth Lagna) represents the\nphysical body, the Moon Lagna the subtle body (and hence desire\nmanifestation), and the Sun Lagna the causal body (and hence\nthought manifestation).

One born in Gaja\nKesari Yoga will be splendorous, wealthy, intelligent, endowed with many\nlaudable virtues, and will please the king. (j6:j-4)\n The lesser combination of Moon and Jupiter in angles to each other is\nin Phaladipika given the simpler name of Kesari Yoga, but even in\nthis watered-down version of the yoga it is still important for\nJupiter and the Moon to be in good houses from the ascendant.\nSince one full third of all horoscopes display Jupiter in a kendra\nfrom the Moon, it is wise to ensure that the combination satisfies\nParashara's more stringent criteria before predicting the results\npromised for the yoga. A Moon in the twelfth house and a debili-\ntated and combust Jupiter in the third house would clearly be very\nunlikely to produce noticeably good results.\n In Chart I the Moon is in the fifth house and Jupiter in the\nsecond house, but, although this Jupiter is in an angle from the\nMoon and is exalted, it is also combust and conjoined with Rahu. In\nthis case no Gaja Kesari Yoga is formed. A Gaja Kesari Yoga, even\nif in good houses from the ascendant, is also unlikely to yield\nbeneficial effects if the Moon is depleted (i.e. if the birth was within\nfive days either side of the new Moon). A good Gaja Kesari Yoga is\nsaid to be particularly useful for politicians.\n This yoga appears almost fully formed in Chart 2, and was the\ncause of the following true story.

Maha BhaQa\nmeans 'exceedingly auspicious'.\nNEEXHA B H A N G A R A J A Y O G A : Certain planetary combinations can\nmodify the detrimental effects of a graha's debilitation. Canceled\ndebility does not become equal to an exaltation or some other\ndesirable placement, however. Debility is debility, and Neecha\nBhanga is no more perfect than is a prosthesis applied to a limbless\nbody. Giving a debilitated graha a cane with which to walk will\nenable the graha to exert some beneficial effects but, even if it\nexcels at its duties, it will still never be normal. Moreover, Neecha\nBhanga creates a Raja Yoga on4 when the debilitated graha occupies\na kendra or a kona; otherwise the planet's debility will merely be\nremoved.\n Four of the most important ways in which debility can be\ncanceled are: (I) if the lord of the rashi occupied by the debilitated\ngraha is in a kendra position from the Moon or Lagna; (2) if the\nlord of the rashi where the debilitated graha is exalted is in a kendra\nposition from the Moon or Lagna; (3) if the lord of the rashi\noccupied by the debilitated graha aspects that graha; or (4) if the\nplanet who would be exalted in the rashi occupied by the debilitated\ngraha is in a kendra from the Moon or from the Lagna.\n As an example, take Saturn in Aries. If Mars (I - Saturn's\ndispositor), Venus (2 - lord of Saturn's exaltation rashi) or the Sun\n(4 - who is exalted in Aries) occupies a kendra from the Moon or\nfrom the Lagna, or if Mars aspects Aries (j), Saturn's debility will\nbe canceled.

Because the\nseventh house is a maraka house, and the eighth house is the worst\nof the trik houses, any planets in those houses should be benefics in\norder to modify their results. Whenever a malefic occupies the\nseventh, it will damage the first house, while a malefic in the eighth\nhouse will create immense suffering and reduce the lifespan. A\nbenefic in the eighth house will at least modify the negative effects\nof the eighth house, though much of the benefit promised by that\nbenefic will be lost.

Usually referred to it1 North and West India as\n'being Mangalik,' Kuja Dosha (as it is usually known in South\nIndia) occurs whenever Mars occupies houses one, two, four, seven,\neight or twelve in a horoscope. It is unique among yogas in that it\nis counted not just from the ascendant but also from the Moon and\nfrom Venus, and is regarded as being particularly virulent when it\nrecurs from all three positions.\n Kuja Dosha is probably the best-known of graha yogas among\nIndia's general public, and many Indians still assiduously avoid\nmarrying anyone with Kuja Dosha. While this yoga originally\nindicated the death of the spouse, it was later modified to mean\nmarital misery. Mangala usually means 'auspicious'; most Indian\nwomen wear wedding necklaces called mangala sz/tras instead of\nwedding rings. But Mangala is also a name for Mars, a violent and\nargumentative graha who does not promote marital harmony when\nconfigured with one of the houses of relationship. While it is said\nthat Mars can sometimes become auspicious for a lucky individual,\nsome jyotishis believe that Mars is called Mangala in honor of all\nthe penances, sacrifices and other auspicious actions a native must\ndo to avert his evil effects.\n Mars in the first house causes Kuja Dosha because of the impor-\ntance of the first house as an epitome of the horoscope, and because\nthe first house, being the seventh house from the seventh house, is a\nsort of derivative of the seventh house. Also, when Mars occupies\nthe ascendant, he aspects both the seventh house (the house of\nmarriage) and the eighth house (the mangaba stbana, or house of the\nduration of married life; the mangala szrtra is its symbol). Mars in the\nsecond house causes Kuja Dosha because the second house both\nrules family life and, being the eighth from the seventh house,\nrepresents the partner's longevity, and because from the second\nhouse Mars aspects both the fifth house of progeny and the eighth\nhouse.",

Mars in the seventh house disrupts\nmarried life directly, and also does so indirectly by aspecting both\nthe first and second houses. Mars in the eighth house adversely\naffects the eighth by occupation and the second by aspect; and\nMars in the twelfth house disturbs the positive indications of that\nbhava (like the pleasures of the bed) and also aspects the seventh\nhouse.\n There is an alarming tendency among immature jyotishis to\nbecome unnecessarily alarmed when they discover this combination\nin a horoscope. Since half of all horoscopes that are counted\nfrom the lagna, half of those counted from the Moon, and half\ncounted from Venus must possess this blemish, well over half the\nworld's population must suffer from it. If Kuja Dosha could not\nbe mitigated, its dire results, including the early death of the life\npartner, would occur in a substantial majority of the population,\nwhich is not the case. Exceptions to Kuja Dosha are therefore\nvery important and in fact are so numerous that they could consti-\ntute a full chapter in themselves. Here are four of the most impor-\ntant ones:\n(I) Generally speaking, anyone who has'Kuja Dosha can safely\n marry anyone else who has a Kuja Dosha of approximately\n equal strength, because the two combinations will cancel each\n other out.\n(2) One tradition says that even the strongest Kuja Dosha is over\n and done with once the native reaches the age of thirty, because\n Mars reaches maturity at age twenty-eight (see Chapter Four)\n and that any marital mischance which occurs after age thirty to\n someone whose horoscope shows a strong Kuja Dosha is\n probably due to other factors. Marriages contracted by such\n people prior to age twenty-eight usually end unhappily, though\n they will not necessarily end prior to age twenty-eight.\n(3) Mars in its own or exaltation rashi greatly modifies any Kuja\n Dosha position and perhaps even cancels it ('perhaps', because\n the experts disagree on this point).",

In Kala Sarpa Yoga, all the seven planets from the Sun\nthrough to Saturn are situated in between Rahu and Ketu. The\nTwo Nodes are described as shadow planets because they are\nliterally shadows, the shadows which cause eclipses. Mythologically\nthey are two portions of the same body, the body of a demon who\nhad tried to steal the nectar of immortality. When the Sun and the\nMoon tattled on the rascal, Lord Vishnu beheaded the knave with\nHis discus just as a drop of the nectar was dribbling down the\nfiend's throat; this made both his halves immortal. Enraged at this\ntreachery, the Two Nodes perpetually chase and seize the Two\nLuminaries, who perpetually wriggle out of their grasp after a few\nmoments of adumbration.\n Kala Sarpa Yoga, which is not mentioned in any classical work\non Jyotish, is probably Tantric in origin, given the Tantric fascina-\ntion with shadows, with time (kala means both 'black' and 'time',\nand here refers to Ketu) and serpents (sarpa, which here refers to\nRahu), with the occult (which the nodes rule), and with demonic\nbeings (which they are). Kala Sarpa Yoga is described in Dravidian\n(South Indian) treatises, but even here there is no consensus as to its\neffect. Some texts describe it as a major flaw in a birth chart, a yoga\nwhich portends loss of everything, while others say that it bestows\nhappiness and the goodwill of kings - provided that the child who\npossesses it survives.\n There is not even consensus on its formation, which is not\nsurprising, considering the confusion that is natural to the nodes.\nSome say that 'Rahu bites with his head', which means that Rahu",

Yet another\n group considers Kala Sarpa Yoga to be formed in either way, an\n approach which seems to be verified by experience.\n Two types of Kala Sarpa are thus distinguished: (I) Andoma\n ('normal direction') type - all planets moving toward Rahu; this\n type is less likely to give trouble than is the other; and (2) Vdoma\n ('reverse direction') type - all planets moving toward Ketu, which\ncan cause prosperity but will give troubles side by side.\n The Yoga is still formed even if there are planets conjoined (in\nthe same house) with either Rahu or Ketu or both, so long as these\nplanets are within the nodal axis by degree position; but a 'true' Kala\nSarpa is formed only when the planets are in contiguous constella-\ntions. All five intervening rashis need not be tenanted by planets,\nbut all the planets must clump together. The situation is worse\nwhen the planets are evenly distributed because during their transits\n(see Chapter Eleven) Rahu or Ketu will continuously pass over one\nplanet after another, generating crises as they go. The texts neglect\nto say whether the ascendant must be included in the houses\ncontained within the Serpent's belly (i.e. the houses which are\ntrapped between Rahu and Ketu), or whether there is a way to\ncancel its effects (in the way that debility can be canceled by Neecha\nBhanga Yoga).\n The difficulties created by a Kala Sarpa Yoga typically focus on:\n(a) the houses ruled by any graha that either Rahu or Ketu conjoins,\nor (b) the houses ruled by one or both of the dispositors of Rahu\nand Ketu, or (c) the houses Rahu and Ketu occupy. This is usually\nan eitherlor situation in that one of the above houses is ordinarily a\nvery noteworthy indicator of the problems the Yoga causes.

The astrological rulerships of life's diverse ages will therefore\ntend to indicate distinct and unique results, given the wide variations\nin planetary positions from horoscope to horoscope.\n Vimshottari Dasha is also known as Nakshatra Dasha because its\nyears are parceled out, albeit unequally, to each of the nine nakshat-\nras which embody the 120\" of space which is one-third of the\nzodiac. The nine nakshatras from Ashvini to Ashlesha cover the\nconstellations Aries to Cancer, the nine nakshatras from Magha to\nJyeshtha cover the constellations Leo to Scorpio, and the nine from\nMula to Revati cover Sagittarius to Pisces. In the Vimshottari\nsystem, the Vedic rulerships of the nakshatras are replaced with a\nsystem of planetary rulers, and each of the three groups of nine\nnakshatras has an identical sequence of rulers, beginning with Ketu\nand ending with Mercury (as shown in Table I I.

Likewise, the condition of the\nfourth house suggests that in matters of property he will experi-\nence general success throughout his life, with the odd cloud dark-\nening his door due to the aspects of the natural malefics Mars\nand Saturn. These dark clouds will probably be more in evidence\nduring the dashas of these two grahas, while Jupiter, whose influ-\nence is exclusively benefic on the fourth house, may during its\ndasha (ages 18 to 34) give the enjoyment of property, which has in\nfact been the case.\n\n Chart I : Jupiter Dasha\nBelow are some of the things Jupiter indicated for the owner of\nChart I during his Jupiter Dasha, which he saw from the ages of 16\nthrough 32.

First we examine Saturn's house lordship, to\ndetermine whether he is a temporary benefic or malefic for this\nlagna. While Saturn does own the good ninth house, it is also the\nlord of the evil eighth house, so (according to Principles 8 and 9)\nthese lordships will neither subtract from nor improve Saturn's\naspects. But since the fundamental nature of malefics always causes\nthem to retain a flavor of struggle and imperfection, no matter how\ntemporarily benefic they may become, the natural malefic Saturn is\nbound to create some sort of havoc in every horoscope during its\ndasha.\n To see how and where these problems will crop up, we must\nexamine the houses that Saturn occupies, aspects, and owns in the\nhoroscope. Saturn's seat in the first house as a natural malefic will\ndisturb the first house of health (Principle j), and indeed the native\nhas experienced a number of significant health problems during\nSaturn's dasha. Many of these problems involved the bones, which\nSaturn naturally rules, with the specific involvement of some of the\nbones of his neck, a portion of the body ruled by Gemini, which\nSaturn occupies.\n Saturn sits in the ascendant as a natural malefic, so its aspects on\nthe third, seventh and tenth houses disturb those houses (Principle\n3). It was during the period of Saturn that one of this man's\nyounger sisters (third house) died. Severe marital problems (seventh\nhouse) began during this period, which were aggravated by a\nserious deterioration in his wife's health.

Due to the eighth-\nhouse influence, the native experienced death in the form of the\ntragic demise of his wife and sister; he had several vehicular\naccidents, and one badly broken leg; and he experienced bankruptcy\n(Principle I I). Yet he also traveled widely, took to the serious study\nof scriptures and religious practices, and was initiated by a religious\npreceptor on a pilgrimage to India - all ninth-house matters (Prin-\nciple 10). The results indicated by Saturn owning both the eighth\nand ninth bhavas were thus cumulative and did not cancel. In his\ncase, travel was particularly supported because Saturn's dispositor\nMercury occupies the third house, another travel house, from which\nit aspects the ninth house.\n Finally, while Saturn is unaspected and is not associated with any\nother planet, it does aspect both Mercury and Venus. Saturn as lord\nof the eighth bhava aspecting Mercury, who rules the first and\nfourth bhavas, could for example indicate the 'death' (loss) of\nvehicles or property (fourth house), or an accident to the native\n(first house). Saturn as lord of the ninth aspecting Mercury may\nindicate long-distance travel during Saturn's dasha, and in fact all\nthese matters have been ongoing themes in the native's life during\nthis dasha.\n The influence of eighth- and ninth lord Saturn on Venus (the fifth\nlord) may be interpreted as an influence on the lord of children by\nthe lord of death and the lord of dharma. This may indicate loss of a\nchild, or perhaps a need to fulfill one's dharma in relation to a child.\nBoth interpretations have been accurate during the Saturn dasha:\nafter his wife's death he agonized over making the right decision\nabout his daughter's welfare, finally deciding to lodge her with\nrelatives in a different country, thus becoming permanently sepa-\nrated from her.

The dashas\nenable one to see the forest, and the bbuktis (the smaller periods of\ntime within the dashas) enable one to focus on the trees in that\nforest. The bhuktis (also known as antaras) are minor periods or\nsub-periods within the major planetary period that is a dasha.\nDashas are sometimes called Maha Dashas ('Major Dashas') to\ndistinguish them from bhuktis.\n Bbukti comes from the root word bbuj, meaning 'to enjoy, partici-\npate in, or consume', which harks back to the digestive meanings of\nthe word dasha. Each major period is divided into nine minor\nperiods which are each allotted to one graha, in the same order that\ncharacterizes the dasha. A simple way to determine the length of .a\nbhukti is to employ the so-called Rule of Three: multiply the\nnumber of years allotted in the Vimshottari Dasha to the major\nperiod lord by the number of years allotted to the minor lord, then\ndivide by ten and detach the remainder. The answer indicates the\nnumber of months in the minor period, and when the remainder is\nmultiplied by three that answer indicates the number of days which\nmust be added to the number of months to give the minor period's\ntotal length.\n For example, to calculate the period of Mars within the major\nperiod of Rahu, a period usually expressed in astrological shorthand\nas Rahu-Mars, multiply the 18 years of the Rahu Dasha by the 7\nyears of the Mars Dasha to arrive at 126.

Therefore the first bhukti in the\n Maha Dasha of the Sun is that of the Sun itself (written Sun-Sun);\n in the major period of Mercury it is Mercury-Mercury, and so on.\n After the initial bhukti, the remaining eight minor periods follow\n the natural order of rulerships in the Vimshottari Dasha, continuing\n with the graha that follows the ruler of the first minor period in this\n natural order. The natural order of the Vimshottari Dasha, as given\nabove, is Ketu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn and\nMercury. The major period of the Sun thus has these nine minor\nperiods: Sun-Sun, Sun-Moon, Sun-Mars, Sun-Rahu, Sun-Jupiter,\n Sun-Saturn, Sun-Mercury, Sun-Ketu and Sun-Venus.\n For convenience, Table I I . 3 provides the order and the duration\nof each bhukti within each Maha Dasha.\n Bhukti division proceeds as a sort of process of extracting harmon-\nics, so perhaps a musical analogy may make the subject a bit easier\nto understand. Let us first take each dasha cycle of 120 years to\nequal a scale which covers a full octave (imagining for a moment\nthat each octave contained nine notes instead of the usual seven). A\nscale that goes from A to A will sound very different from one\nwhich goes from C to C, or from F# to F#, because the scale's\ninitial tone (the keynote or tonic) determines the form each of the\nfollowing notes will take.

Each series of dashas\nis like a separate musical key, with its own specific number of flats\nor sharps and its own peculiar flavor. Because each set of bhuktis\nbegins with the minor period of the dasha lord, each set has a\ndifferent progression and thus its own melody within the context of\nthe major period.\n The minor periods are often divided into yet smaller sub-sub-\nperiods, by the same procedure, and these can be subdivided into\nyet smaller sub-sub-sub-periods.

Venus also occupies a\ndussthana in an enemy's constellation. Confluence also indicated his\n travel during Saturn-Venus, this time the confluence of Saturn as\nninth lord in a kendra house with Venus as a natural benefic\naspecting the ninth house of travel, and Saturn as ninth lord\naspecting Venus as twelfth lord (the twelfth being a house of\n relocation or immigration) in third house of journeys.

You then might predict marriage without\npausing to consider the condition of the natal Saturn. But if at the\ntime of birth Saturn was combust or debilitated, the activation of\nthe seventh house in such a horoscope by transiting Saturn may\npromote marital disharmony, and may even cause divorce. Transiting\nplanets can activate restllts promised in the horoscope, but they cannot change\nthe nature of those results.\n Mantreshwara goes on to say:\nIf the planet whose bhukti is in progress should during the course of his\ntransit pass through his debilitation or enemy's house or become combust,\nthere will be much misery. Should he pass through his own or exaltation\nhouse or be retrograde, the effects will then be good.

If, for\nexample, your moon occupies Aries, your sade sati (Hindi for 'seven\nand a half') will consist of those years during which Saturn wanders\nthrough the constellations Pisces, Aries and Taurus. While the\norigins of this principle of sade sati are unclear, and while it does not\nappear as such in the standard classical texts on Jyotish, it is\nrecognized byell practicing jyotishis, and is superstitiously feared\nby millions of Indians.

These houses will often be unfavorably activated, depending\nboth on Saturn's strength in the natal chart, and on the strength of\nthe transiting Saturn.

A Saturn which is afflicted natally\nby combustion, debilitation, residence in a trik house, or like\nweakness may give miserable results, as may a Saturn who, even if\nstrong in the natal chart, is weak by its transit position.\n3 Look for conjuence. When a strong natal Jupiter and a strong\ntransiting Jupiter occupy or aspect the same house, positive results\nare more likely to accrue. When a malefic natal Saturn influences a\nhouse, and transit Saturn reactivates that house, negative results\nbecome more certain.\n One example, in Chart 2, involves Jupiter, which transited his\nnatal twelfth house from mid-1991 through mid-1992, from where it\nrestimulated by aspect his strong natal Jupiter in the fourth house.\nDuring this period, Chart 2's owner acquired a new vehicle (one of\nthe matters indicated by the fourth house).

If desirable results are anticipated on the basis of the natal\nplacements of the dasha and bhukti lords during long bhuktis (such\nas Venus-Rahu), such results are more likely to begin during a year\nwhen transit Jupiter stimulates those placements. Similarly, if unde-\nsirable results are anticipated on the basis of the natal placements of\nthe dasha and bhukti lords during long bhuktis, such results are\nmore likely to begin during a year when transit Saturn stimulates\nthose placements.",

    "output": "This birth chart of the famous renunciate yogi and founder of the\n Self-Realization Fellowship demonstrates convincingly the use and\nimportance of a broad knowledge of yogas. At first glance this\nhoroscope displays none of the prominent yogas listed in Chapter\nTen: there is no Parivartana Yoga, no exalted planet and no strong\nDharma Karma Adhipati Yoga; the only planet in its own rashi is\n Jupiter, who is seated in the eighth house conjunct with Mars and\naspected by Saturn; and two flashy, sensual planets (Moon and\nVenus) occupy the kendras. There is a potentially detrimental\n Shakata Yoga, since the Moon is in the sixth house from Jupiter\nbut, because the Moon is in a kendra from the lagna, it is cancelled.\n There is however a good Budhaditya Yoga. The Sun and Mercury\noccupy the fifth house of discernment with the Sun as the lord of\nthe lagna. This activates both houses (the first and the fifth) which\nmust be activated for the yoga to give outstanding results. The\neffects of this yoga are enhanced because it recurs from the Moon\nLagna, it is unaffected by any malefics, and it occurs in the beneficial\nconstellation of Sagittarius, whose lord Jupiter (a graha who indi-\ncates wisdom and discernment) occupies its own rashi. Yogananda\nwas known for his sharp mind, his powers of discernment, and his\noratorical abilities (Mercury as lord of speech and of the second\nhouse involved in the Budhaditya Yoga).\n The Moon, lord of the twelfth house of renunciation, seclusion\nand ashramas, occupies the first house (a good house), and the\ntwelfth house is aspected only by the benefic Jupiter. This creates a\nMusala Yoga, which causes difficulties in mundane life but enables\nthe native to make good spiritual progress and tends to lead him to\nreside in foreign countries. Since everyone whose twelfth lord\noccupies the lagna will not show spiritual tendencies, we must look\nfor confluence to support this conclusion. We find it in two key\ncombinations which exerted a crucial influence on Yogananda's life.\nThese combinations are rarely mentioned in modern books on\nJyotish, but they do appear in many of the classics, in chapters\ndevoted to Pravrqya Yogas (combinations for renunciation).\n The first combination, which Phaladipika 6:28 refers to as Srikan-\ntha Yoga, occurs when the lord of the lagna, the Sun, and the\nMoon occupy a kendra or a kona in their exaltation, own, or",

Such a person will be 'decked with rudraksha\n rosaries, his body whitened by being smeared with sacred ash', both\nrudraksha beads and sacred ashes being symbols of renunciate\nyogis. These symbols should be regarded symbolically for the most\npart for, while Yogananda was a renunciate, he did not prominently\nwear either rudraksha beads or sacred ashes, nor was he a sectarian\ndevotee of Shiva. He was, however, devoted to the Universal Soul,\nof which Lord Shiva is the embodiment, and was renowned for his\nrespect for all religions.\n The second Pravrajya Yoga (Brihat Parashara Hora 79:8) is formed\nby the Moon occupying a rashi of Mars and being aspected by\nSaturn in the navamsha chart. In Yogananda's- navamsha chart the\nMoon sits in Aries, where it is aspected by Saturn from Cancer.

That he did squeak through was thanks only to his guru's\nintervention. We might predict that his guru would assist him\nbecause of the strong aspect of the benefic Jupiter (acting here in its\nliteral capacity of guru) on the dasha lord Venus.\n Yogananda left India in August 1920 during his ~ u n - ~ u ~Ji t e\nperiod, which lasted from 14 May 1920 to 2 March 1921, probably\nbecause the Sun's dispositor Jupiter aspects the twelfth house of\nimmigration while occupying the eighth house, which is another of\nthe houses of travel. Jupiter thus strongly indicates travel, journeys\nwhich would probably be safe because Jupiter occupies the nakshatra\nof Revati, which promises 'protection, shelter and hospitality while\ntraveling'. The Sun's position in Purva Ashadha would suggest\n'voyages by rivers and seas' to reach his destination.\n If we now take Phaladipika's advice and examine the transits of\nthe dasha and bhukti lords, we discover that during August 1920\nJupiter would have been in the early degrees of Leo, transiting\nYogananda's natal Moon (the lord of the twelfth), and aspecting\nboth the natal Sun in the fifth house and the ninth house of long-\ndistance travel.

It was during these zj years that he became known as a\n spiritual figure, and that his influence spread extensively. Yogananda\n left his body on 7 March I 95 2 during Rahu-Ketu (26 October 195 I\n to 1 2 November 1952). Rahu is disposited by Mars, who occupies\n the eighth house of the end of longevity, and Ketu occupies the\n third bhava, the other longevity house. The dasha and bhukti of\ntwo malefics connected to these two houses is not at all good for\nlongevity. His end was sudden, which is typical of the action of the\nnodes. At that time transit Ketu occupied the lagna, and Rahu sat\nby transit in the seventh bhava, a maraka house. Seventh lord\nSaturn is a powerful maraka in this horoscope because it occupies\nthe second bhava, another maraka house.\n Jupiter in Yogananda's horoscope tenants his own rashi in the\neighth house, which normally would suggest heightened longevity.\nThat Yogananda died at the relatively young age of 59 is due in part\nto the conjunction of that Jupiter with the malefic Mars, and to the\naspect of the malefic Saturn, the double maraka. This position of\nJupiter was powerful enough to give Yogananda great posthumous\nfame, and may be one reason why his body did not decay for at least\nthree weeks after he died.\nFURTHERMORE While we have confined ourselves here predomi-\nnantly to the principles of interpretation outlined in the chapters\nabove, similar results could have been obtained by other methods of\ninterpretation. For example, remember that in Jaimini Jyotish which-\never planet is most advanced in any constellation is called the\nsignificator of soul (Atma Karaka), and whatever navamsha this\nplanet occupies is called the karakamsba. In Yogananda's horoscope\nthe Atma Karaka is Venus, who by virtue of sitting in Aquarius in\nthe navamsha makes Aquarius the karakamsha. Chapter One, Part\n11, Verse 1 2 of the Jaimini Sutram tells us that such a native will\nperform charitable works, an interpretation which is reinforced by\nJupiter's simultaneous occupation of Aquarius in the navamsha.\nWhen the Arudha Lagna, a numerological principle that Jaimini\napplies to the lagna, is added to this interpretation, it creates the\nequivalent, in Jaimini terms, of the Pravrajya Yogas.",

This is because\nSaturn, the yoga's dispositor Oiva), is exalted and retrograde, occu-\npies a kendra, and is aspected by two benefics and no malefics. The\nmore significant yoga in Monroe's chart, the one which was respon-\nsible for her incredible fame, is a very powerful Parvata Yoga, as\ndefined by Phaladipzka. The ascendant lord Moon creates this yoga\nby occupying the seventh house and aspecting the ascendant. Moon's\ndispositor Saturn, while not in his own rashi, is, as noted above,\nvery powerful, and is aspected by his own dispositor, who happens\nto be his friend.\n A Parvata Yoga is said to make a person wealthy (very), charitable\n(she did volunteer to do charitable work), eloquent (in a sense),\nlearned in classical subjects (she studied 'classical' method acting),\nfond of mirth (she was a gifted comedienne), famous (definitely),\nsplendiferous (to most), and the leader of a city (the toast of\nHollywood).

In Monroe's case a weaker Jupiter leaves Venus un-\nchecked, and she lacks Yogananda's rare, powerful renunciate yogas.\nThe result was that Monroe was prepared to play the sexpot. These\nparallel combinations producing different results in the charts of\nMonroe and Yogananda starkly illustrate the difficulties a jyotishi\nencounters when trying to deliver accurate judgements.\nTHE LAGNA A N D B H A V A S Predictions about the moral character of\na person require much experience and sensitivity and cannot be\nblindly made on the basis of a single indication in a chart. In\nMonroe's case, aside from the influences listed above, Rahu's pres-\nence in the twelfth house of bed pleasures strongly indicates intense\nsexual indulgence, for Rahu represents 'cravings that cannot be\nsatisfied'. Fortunately Jupiter's aspect curbed this passion to some\ndegree, for without this cover from Jupiter a twelfth-house Rahu in\nan otherwise afflicted chart can lead to debauchery.\n Monroe's lagna is in Cancer, in Ashlesha nakshatra. The themes\nof tragic death and emotional thinking which are significant indica-\ntions for a Cancer ascendant apply to her exceptionally well. Ashle-\nsha's indications appeared plentifully in her life: she represented\nprimordial sexuality, conducted secret love affairs, was subjected\nto and engaged in major manipulations, cast a hypnotic spell on\nher audiences, and was an expert at illusion. She was a frequent\nuser of poisons (alcohol and barbiturates), and was either killed or\ncommitted suicide with poison. 6\n One of the most important reasons for Monroe's fame was the\nstrength of her lagna. Moon's aspect on the ascendant renders the\nlatter strong, and the Moon is itself strong because Monroe was\nborn less than ten days after the full Moon. Saturn, the lord of the\nMoon Lagna, strengthens that lagna by being in a kendra, exalted,\nretrograde, and aspected by two natural benefics, one of whom,\nVenus, is the Raja Yoga Karaka for the Moon Lagna.

Since, however, all\n results are cumulative they could not prevent this Saturn from\n bringing tragedy, suffering and death, all matters which are naturally\n ruled by Saturn, especially when he rules the eighth house, into\n Monroe's life.\n Monroe was famed for her beauty, a first-house rulership. Her\n allure may be attributed to the confluence of a number of factors,\n including the occupation by the lagna and the Moon of even-\nnumbered constellations. Both Moon and Venus, the other planet\ncapable of bestowing beauty, occupy kendras, and the strong Moon\naspecting its own rashi in the lagna also bestows beauty, or at least\ncharisma. Saturn's aspect on the lagna, which should have detracted\nfrom her good looks, did not because Saturn occupies a rashi of\nVenus while being aspected by Venus, and disposits the Moon.\nThese two influences cause Saturn to carry the effects of both\nVenus and the Moon to the ascendant.\n One reason why Monroe had no full brothers or sisters is that the\nsibling significators, Mars and Jupiter, occupy the eighth house.\nThe third house of younger siblings is aspected by the natural\nmalefic Mars, the enemy of the third lord Mercury, and Mercury is\ncombust and is aspected by Mars.

Her formal education extended no further than high school.\nThat she did enjoy luxurious vehicles and accommodations was\npresumably due to the presence of that exalted Saturn (a property\nsignificator) in the fourth house of property, and to the aspect on the\nfourth house of the fourth lord Venus (the significator for vehicles).\nThe nature and specific indications of the grahas involved must always\nbe considered when trying to determine which of the many indications\nof a particular bhava will be activated in a specific horoscope.\n Mantreshwara's principles of negative house analysis help to\nexplain why Monroe had no children.

This in many ways\ndescribes the results of her career activities, for after a serious nervous\nbreakdown she committed suicide, or was encouraged to do so, at the\ntender age of 36, after a long history of drug and alcohol abuse.\nD A S H A S A N D B H U K T I S Because Mars, who dwells in an enemy's\nrashi in the eighth house, conjoins Jupiter, the sixth lord, Monroe's\nMars Maha Dasha, which she experienced over the first five years of\nher life, was awful. She lived in foster homes, and never knew her\nfather. Although by rulership Mars has little to do with parents in\nthis chart, they were affected here because she was too young to\nexperience the effects herself. In such cases, the results go to the\nchild's protectors (poshakas), who are frequently his or her parents.\nAlso, Mars as a natural malefic flanks the Moon (afflicting thereby\nthe natural significator of mother) and aspects the Sun (the natural\nsignificator of father). Mars also afflicts Jupiter, the ruler of the\nninth house (father). Some attribute her career success to the Raja\nYoga in her eighth house, but if this were the case the dasha of the\nRaja Yoga Karaka Mars should have given her good results, not bad.\n The Rahu Maha Dasha included life in an orphanage (during\nRahu-Jupiter, which began in September 193 5 ) because Rahu occu-\npies the twelfth house (confinement) of the natal chart.

Whenever the ninth\nlord being Jupiter occupies the eighth house, one's good fortune is\ntriply detrimented, for the eighth is a dussthana both from the lagna\nand from the house itself (being twelfth from the ninth), and\nJupiter as natural significator of good fortune is in the dungeon of\nthe horoscope. Nor did the rest of the dasha produce success,\nmainly because of the general weakness of dasha lord Rahu, who sat\nin the twelfth disposited by a seriously combust Mercury. As Rahu\nis also debilitated in the navamsha, the marriage she contracted\nduring this period did not work out.",

Her amazing career success\nduring this bhukti was due less to Jupiter's participation in the weak\nRaja Yoga, and more so due to her sterling dashamsha (the one-tenth\ndivision), the divisional chart which relates to career. In this chart\nMonroe's Jupiter occupies the seventh house in its own rashi of\nPisces, unafflicted in any manner, creating a marvelous Hamsa Yoga.\n From April 19jr through April 1913 Jupiter transited her tenth\nhouse of career, from which position it fully aspected bhukti lord\nSaturn; then from August 17j3 until the end of the Saturn bhukti\nSaturn transited Libra, its exaltation rashi, thereby restimulating its\nnatal position and significations. This restimulation also influenced\nSaturn in its role as lord of the seventh house of marriage, and so it\nwas then that Monroe married Joe DiMaggio on 14 January 19j4,\nwhen dasha lord Jupiter was transiting the eleventh house, whence\nit aspected her seventh house. 8\n Marilyn Monroe died on j August 1762,during Jupiter-Mars,\ntwo grahas which occupy the eighth house of death.

This is a most appropriate combination for a warlord.\n The very strength of the Ruchaka Yoga made the majority of the\ntextual indications for Ruchaka Yoga appear quite literally in Hitler's\n life: a long face, great enthusiasm, a very forceful personality, great\nluster and charisma, a love of fighting wars, lots of anger, victory\nover enemies (until the very end of his life), good knowledge- of\nmantras and occult sciences (Hitler had an obsessive interest in the\noccult), a protector of thieves, a cruel personality, and death by\nweapons or fire. This is an accurate summation of Hitler, right\ndown to the self-inflicted gunshot wound which caused his death,\nand the subsequent burning of his body at his request.\n Mars, the dispositor of lagna lord Venus, occupies his own rashi\nin a kendra to form a Parvata Yoga, which is strengthened by\nJupiter's powerful aspect on Mars. Because the Hamsa Yoga created\nby Jupiter occurs only from the Moon and Sun Lagnas, Jupiter is\nless powerful an influence in the chart than the belligerent Mars.\nThe Budhaditya Yoga is configured with the lagna by aspecting it,\ngiving Hitler the intelligence to rise to his exalted position from\nvery humble beginnings, and the talent to have been a successful\nauthor. A Dharma Karma Adhipati Yoga is created by the conjunc-\ntion of Venus and Mercury, and another k& the mutual aspect of\nMars and Saturn. The Kesari Yoga is created by Jupiter being in a\nkendra as counted from the Moon but, because neither planet sits in\na strong house from the ascendant, that yoga is weak.\n Hitler's chart also contains a Pravrajya Yoga, in that four or\nmore planets occupy a single house (Brihat Parashara Hora 7 9 : ~ ) ) .\nThis yoga is not supported elsewhere in the horoscope, though, and\nbecause the warlike Mars was the strongest planet involved in the\nyoga, Hitler's path led him deep into the occult, instead of into\nspirituality, particularly because ninth lord Mercury is combust.\nHitler was, however, a private person in many ways and enjoyed\nfrequent retreats to his Valhalla in the mountains. The yoga probably\nalso encouraged him to support the quasi-religious Aryanism which\nwas the spiritual foundation of the Nazi Party.",

The Moon Lagna is strong because\n Jupiter, its lord, occupies his own rashi. The Sun Lagna is similarly\n strong, for its lord Mars occupies his own rashi and is far enough\nfrom the Sun not to be combust. While two or three of the lagnas\nin the horoscopes of Yogananda, Monroe and Hitler are strong, it is\n only in Yogananda's chart that all three lagnas are free from the\naspect of a natural malefic who is not also a Raja Yoga Karaka.\nYogananda accordingly had a sterling character and a relatively\nsmooth life.

Other meanings of Chitra which apply to\nHitler include: he was very hard to defeat; he liked the arts, and was\na competent sketcher and watercolorist; he was very conspicuous,\nambitious and charismatic; he was a successful author; and he had a\ngift for oratory. His Libra ascendant gave him both a strong\ninterest in politics and an inability to listen to good advice. This\nincapacity to hear contrary opinions prevented Hitler's subordinates\nfrom daring to contradict him, even when his plans were unbal-\nanced.

Here\nMercury, Sun, Mars and Venus all contributed to Hitler something\nof their nature.

The Sun's influence is maximal because it sits within\none degree of its maximum exaltation, in a kendra, configured with\nthe lagna and its lord, and aspected by its powerful friend Jupiter.\nThis puissant, cruel Sun, coupled with the influence of the violent,\ncruel Mars and the effect of the Ugra Nakshatras, contributed\nmightily to Hitler's diabolical megalomania.\n The third house (courage, enterprise and adventure) in this\nhoroscope is strong because it is occupied by its lord, Jupiter. Ketu,\nwhich also dwells in the third, acted like Mars to enhance Hitler's\ncourage, which was undeniable: He was awar d two Iron Crosses 4for bravery during the First World War and, even when wounded\nin the leg, he begged his superior officer to be allowed to stay at the\nfront rather than be transported to a rear-echelon hospital.\n HitIer had a poor record in secular education; he failed even to\nobtain the usual secondary school certificate, and never resumed his\nformal education thereafter. Although his fourth house was aspected\nby its lord Saturn, the grahas which represent education (Mercury\nand Jupiter) influence neither the fourth house nor its lord. In the\nabsence of their influence, other matters of the fourth house came\nto the fore. In Hitler's case they came in the form of property\nownership, which Saturn represents. That he was actively interested\nin learning despite his limited secular educational attainments was\ndue to the strength of his Budhaditya Yoga.\n As with Monroe's chart, Hitler's seventh house of romantic\npartnerships and fourth house of morals are influenced by Venus,\nMars and Saturn. In Hitler's case this is because Venus occupies a\nrashi of Mars in the seventh house and is conjoined with Mars as\nlord of the seventh, and both are aspected by Saturn as lord of the\nfourth.

Geli committed suicide in September 193I .\n Hitler lost his bastard father at age fourteen. The ninth house of\nfather is occupied by Rahu, and the aspect of the Moon is not very\nhelpful on two counts: it is waning, anrl it carries the influence of\nSaturn, the only planet that occupies the Moon's constellation of\nCancer.

Jupiter as a natural benefic may\nhave made the father moral (the father's subjective reality), but\nJupiter as the lord of evil houses contributed to removing him from\nHitler's life early on (Hitler's objective reality).

Rahu in its own capacity as a\ni 'shadow planet' threw by its aspect on the Moon (the significator of\nI\nI the mind) a shadow on Hitler's mind, for a Rahu-Moon combination\ni is usually pernicious, and at its worst can lead to madness. This\n influence became emphasized during Rahu Dasha, because the aspect of\n Moon on Rahu enabled Rahu to give the results promised by the Moon\n - who also occupies an Ugra Nakshatra. Mercury, Rahu's dispositor,\n adds a further flavor of trauma by being seriously combust.\n It is because Jupiter tenants its own rashi, and because it influ-\n ences Rahu both by aspect and by nakshatra, that Rahu will\n predominantly give the results of Jupiter. Jupiter's involvement in 8\n the above-mentioned yogas gave Hitler his political successes, and\n Jupiter's position in the Ugra Nakshatra of Purva Ashadha caused\n him to seek and obtain these successes through war and atrocities,\n which led ultimately to his own destruction.\n Hitler became Chancellor in January of I 93 3, during Rahu-Rahu.\n He consolidated his power during Rahu-Jupiter, which began in July\n 1933, by becoming first President and Chancellor and then\n Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces (by August 1934).

As we explained in Chapter Four, it is the planet\nwith the higher latitude which wins such a fight. In this horoscope\n while Venus has a higher longitude than Mars (which has led most\ncommentators to assert that it won the war) it is Mars who has the\n higher latitude. Mars therefore defeats Venus, which is one very\nimportant reason why Mars so dominates this horoscope.\n It is also a powerful reason why Hitler suffered from a very deep\npsychological malaise, and why he was ultimately defeated by the\nAllies, for it was Venus acting as the lord of his ascendant who was\nvanquished by another planet. Hitler could never feel content with\nhis many successes, nor ever felt a victory to be complete until it\nhad been proved by conflict, for he, in the person of his vanquished\nlagna lord, always felt defeated by that mighty Mars. It is because a\nvanquished planet gives dangerous results, according to what it\nactivates in the horoscope, that Hitler's death occurred during the\nVenus Bhukti of his Rahu Maha Dasha, since Venus owns and\ntherefore activates in his chart the first house of life and the eighth\nhouse of the end of longevity. Because Venus occupies the seventh\nhouse of spouse, Hitler's romantic companion of many years, Eva\nBraun, also died during this bhukti.\n It was in fact this defeat of Venus at the hands of Mars which\ncaused Hitler to choose war over art. It was heart-rending for Hitler\nwhen, after living the life of a struggling artist in Vienna during his\nearly twenties, he was twice turned down in his bid to enter the\nAcademy of Fine Arts there, and only on volunteering for the army\nin the First World War did his life start to come together.

Even the lords of the various lagnas predominantly\noccupy even constellations, thereby enhancing the yoga's overall\nstrength and impact. A strong Maha Bhagya Yoga makes one a lord of\nthe earth (i.e. a political leader), as it did for Hitler.\n The Dharma Karma Adhipati Yoga created by Sun and Jupiter\nwhich occurs in the Leo lagna is not matched in the Cancer\nascendant.

Since, except for Bhangas, graha yogas do not cancel one\n another out, but rather operate side by side with other combinations,\n the Papakartari Yoga suggests a Cancer lagna by clearly pointing to\nthe many troubles in her life.

Only a\n Cancer ascendant for Indira Gandhi would create the following\n combinations for unnatural death: (a) the eighth lord, who happens\n to be the malefic Saturn, tenants the ascendant in an enemy's rashi\n unrelieved by the influence of any strong benefic; and (b) the same\n malefic lord of the eighth house aspects the lord of the ascendant,\n who is its enemy. This is strong testimony for the lagna being\n Cancer.\n Gandhi had no brothers or sisters. From a Leo lagna the third\n house of siblings is ruled by Venus, who occupies a kona but in the\n house of its enemy, and is conjoined with the malefic Rahu. From\n Cancer the third lord is Mercury, who also occupies its enemy's\n constellation and who is aspected by the natural malefic Mars. It is,\n however, more severely afflicted than its Leo lagna counterpart,\n Venus, because Mercury is additionally combust. The third house\n from Cancer is also aspected by the malefic Saturn. Taken together,\n Cancer offers a greater astrological testimony for no siblings at all\n than does Leo.\n If we take the eleventh house to rule older siblings, the Cancer\n lagna's eleventh house again portrays the absence of older siblings\n more convincingly than does its Leo counterpart. For the latter\n lagna, Mercury becomes the eleventh lord; while for the Cancer\n lagna, the eleventh lord becomes Venus. Although we have just\n concluded that Venus is better positioned, from the view of the\n third house, in a Leo lagna, in the Cancer lagna Venus occupies a\n dussthana (the sixth) while simultaneously residing in the eighth\n from the eleventh. The presence of the natural benefic Jupiter in the\n eleventh house may deny older siblings since, when a significator\n occupies the house it signifies, it creates problems for the living\n being that house signifies. This reinforces the idea that Cancer may\n be the lagna.\n Gandhi believed formal education to be a waste of time. She tried\n to attend Oxford, but left without a degree after flunking several\n subjects, some for the second time. The fourth house from a Cancer\n lagna is unoccupied and unaspected, while its lord Venus resides in\n the sixth house in its enemy's rashi. Venus also conjoins the natural\n malefic Rahu, and is unaffiliated with the planets of education.",

This\nfourth house is also influenced by the two education planets,\nMercury and Jupiter. Because this all augurs well for secular educa-\n tion, Cancer is a better choice for the lagna, since Gandhi never\ncompleted college.\n This fourth-house reasoning also applies to Gandhi's tubercular\nmother, whose delicate health contributed to her early death. Gandhi\nwas angered by the fact that her mother never really achieved a\ncomfortable position of dignity and respect in the Nehru household.\nThis again validates the Cancer ascendant, since the fourth house in\na Leo ascendant would promise more in the way of dignity, health\nand longevity to the mother.\n Gandhi had two sons and no daughters. Only from the Cancer\nlagna are the fifth house of children and its lord influenced predomi-\nnantly by male factors: here the fifth house being occupied by Sun\nand aspected by Mars and Jupiter (all male planets), and the fifth\nlord Mars occupying a male rashi uninfluenced by any female\nplanets (Mercury here will act like the male planets which influence\nit). From a Leo lagna the fifth house is influenced by Venus and\nRahu, two female grahas, while the fifth lord Jupiter although\naspected by the masculine Sun occupies a female rashi.\n The Cancer Lagna also supports the pre-eminence her sons\nattained (one of them eventually became India's Prime Minister).\nThis is attributable to the Parivartana Yoga involving houses two\nand five from Gandhi's lagna, which become houses one and ten\nwhen we rotate her horoscope to make her fifth house into the first\nhouse for her first-born son. While the Parivartana Yoga for the\nfifth house from the Leo lagna occurs between good houses (five\nand ten), and when the chart is rotated, the yoga now occurs\nbetween houses one and six (as counted from the fifth house), a\nposition which is not as good as the position from Cancer.\n By taking the fifth house of the Cancer ascendant as the lagna, we\nfind that the new eighth lord is combust in the (now) first house,\nwhere it is aspected by the violent Mars.

Since one son died in a plane crash\nand the other by an assassin's bomb, both causes of death can be\nconsidered to be due to fire and heat. This is not evident from a\nLeo lagna, where the fifth lord Jupiter occupies Rohini.\n Gandhi's marriage confirms Cancer lagna from yet another dimen-\n sion. Her married life, though not smooth, did continue for eighteen\nyears, ending with her husband's untimely death from his second\nheart attack. In this lagna the seventh lord aspects its own house\nwhile occupying a kendra, and the seventh house is aspected by the\nnatural benefic Jupiter. The Cancer ascendant likes to keep its\nmarried life secret, and Gandhi regularly denied allegations that her\nmarried life was troubled, claiming to be happy with her mate\nexcept for their decidedly different opinions on politics.\n The marital discord that eventually did surface is partly attribut-\nable to the position of Venus, the principal significator of marriage,\nin the sixth house, conjoined with Rahu, in which position it sits in\nthe twelfth from the seventh house of marriage. Also significant is\nthe fact that the seventh house is strongly configured with Saturn, a\nplanet who does not indicate marital happiness, all other factors\nbeing equal. The same Saturn as the seventh lord occupying a\ndussthana in the Leo ascendant would have more probably led to\ndivorce or lack of marriage, especially considering the aspect of the\nnatural malefic Mars, the seventh lord's enemy, on the seventh\nhouse.\n If we are still uncertain about the seventh house, our doubt is\nrapidly dispelled when we consider her husband's stature as a\nrelatively successful politician in his own right, an elected member\nof India's parliament. This makes sense only from the Cancer lagna,\nin which the seventh lord participates in a desirable Parivartana\nYoga. Also, Gandhi's husband Feroze was a Parsi (a non-Hindu),\nwhich in the context of her upper-class Brahmana upbringing\neffectively meant she had married a foreigner.

This reflects the participation\nof both Jupiter and Saturn in the powerful Parivartana Yogas. In a\nCancer lagna Jupiter, who rules the sixth house, exchanges houses\nwith Venus, the ruler of the eleventh. Phaladipika 6:jz-4 classifies\nthis as a Parivartana Dainya Yoga, to which Mantreshwara ascribes\nthe following results: '. . . will be a fool, will revile others, and will\ncommit sinful actions. He will always be tormented by his enemies,\nwill speak woundingly and will be unsteady in mind. Interruptions\nwill arise to all his undertakings.' Although this Parivartana Yoga\nraised her up, it concurrently caused problems because it belonged\nto the daitya (lowly) class.\n Indira Gandhi attained power for the first time in 1966, during\nJupiter-Sun, and within the remaining four years of Jupiter's main\nperiod, which were her first four years in power, she faced all sorts\nof major problems, including two wars.

The four other Dharma Karma\nAdhipati Yogas in Einstein's birth chart consist of the conjoining of\nthe lords of houses I and j, 4 and j, I and 9, and 4 and 9.

The Malavya\nYoga, which recurs from all three ascendants, is strong because\nVenus is not combust.

    "output": "Einstein's Budhaditya Yoga was blemished to some. extent by\n Mercury's debility. The Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga was one compen-\n sating factor. Another is that the Budhaditya Yoga recurs from the\nMoon Lagna; and a third is that Mercury, as a participant in the\nBudhaditya Yoga, occupies Uttara Bhadrapada, a nakshatra which\ncan stimulate extraordinary abilities or awareness. It is likely to do\nso here because Mercury is a key planet in so many of the afore-\nmentioned yogas. A fourth reason is that the Budhaditya Yoga is\nconjoined with Venus, the lord of the fifth house of intelligence,- who\n is less than I \" away from its maximum exaltation in the tenth\nhouse. Moreover, the fifth house in the Moon Lagna is exceptionally\nwell placed because it contains the Budhaditya Yoga, contains an\nexalted planet, and is involved in a Parivartana Yoga.\n It may be that the Budhaditya Yoga is only a supportive factor,\nand that the prime indicator of Einstein's intelligence is this strength\nof the fifth houses of both the ascendant and the Moon Lagna. We\nfind support for this idea in Mahadeva's Jataka Tatva, which\nsuggests that when a benefic as lord of the fifth occupies a kendra\nor kona and is strong there in a benefic's rashi and is influenced by\nthe 'thinking' planets (Jupiter and Mercury) the native will have\ngreat intelligence. This is a more insightful explanation than that set\nforth by those who assert that Neecha Bhanga makes a planet\nperform even better than it would if not debilitated.\n Einstein's horoscope also contains a Pravrajya Yoga, for four or\nmore planets occupy a single house. Because this yoga has some\nimperfections (i.e., two of the planets involved are combust; see\nBrihat Jataka I j :2) and is not supported elsewhere in the horoscope,\nhe did not go the route of a full-fledged ascetic. He did, however,\nshow many ascetic characteristics.\n One final yoga to consider here is a Saraswati Yoga, a combina-\ntion for knowledge. By definition this combination requires that\nVenus, Jupiter and Mercury all be strong in a kendra, a kona, or the\nsecond house. In Einstein's chart all are in a kendra or a kona, with\nVenus strong by exaltation, Jupiter strong because of the Parivartana\nYoga in which it participates, and Mercury being modestly strong\nbecause of all of the yogas in which it participates, particularly the\nNeecha Bhanga Raja Yoga.",

One reason why he became one of\nthe world's archetypes for intellect is that the numerous yogas in his\nchart are supported by the Sun's rulership of the third house\n (intellect) in a Gemini lagna. Gemini being a dual rashi, with its\nlord in the tenth house in a dual rashi, Einstein had varied career\ninterests. He adopted different countries as home at different stages\nof his life because lagna lord Mercury is also lord of the fourth\nhouse. His health, especially from age jo onward, was delicate, and\nat times a serious problem, as his lagna would suggest.\n His religious interest was, as is typical for Geminis, mainly an\nintellectual analysis of spiritual insights. Einstein himself wrote, 'I\nhave not found a better expression than \"religious\" for the trust in\nthe rational nature of reality that is, at least to a certain extent,\naccessible to human reason' (Clark, p. 502). Nevertheless, the\nstrength of his ninth house caused Einstein to be more inched to\nspiritual matters than are many Geminis.\n Einstein's rising nakshatra was Ardra, whose meanings do not fit\nvery well with his life experiences. If, however, we add a mere three\nminutes to his birthtime, his lagna point enters Punarvasu, whose\ndescriptions seem much more appropriate to him. Punarvasu sup-\nports Einstein's tendency to frequent journeys and public involve-\nment even while remaining substantially aloof from the world. In\nthe last twenty years of his life he traveled very little and lived,\nwhenever possible, a life of solitude, a tendency which was rein-\nforced by the Pravrajya Yoga. Nakshatras can be very useful for\nsuch minor rectification of birthtimes, particularly those which we\nsuspect may have been rounded up or down.\n All three of Einstein's lagnas are rather strong. The ascendant is\naspected by the benefic Jupiter, and lagna lord Mercury, who\noccupies a kendra, participates in many yogas.

It also brought him children and marriage.\n The Sun's Maha Dasha brought Einstein more fame, since the\nSun occupies the tenth bhava of fame with directional strength as\nthe natural significator of fame and as the ruler of the third house\n(mind). During these six years he produced some of his most\nbrilliant work. But only during the planetary period of the Moon\ndid he win the Nobel Prize, during the sub-period of Mars.\n The Moon's grand results are difficult to explain, since it lies\ndebilitated in the sixth house. The Moon is subject to Neecha\nBhanga, no doubt, because its dispositor is exalted, but there is no\nNeecha Bhanga Raja Yoga, because both the Moon and its dispositor\nMars occupy trik houses from the lagna. The award of the Nobel\nPrize during the Moon's period is thus even more difficult to\nexplain when we consider that it happened during the sub-period of\nMars. Jyotish is merely a model of reality, which reflects many but\nnot all aspects of reality in a neatly predictable package. Too many\nastrologers, on finding a certain event inexplicable through a horo-\nscope, ignore the many events that do fit and proclaim the chart to\nbe wrong. Not everything in life is explainable based simply on the\nprinciples used in this book.\n The Moon independently gave Einstein concern over enemies, in\nthe form of the rising specter of Nazism. This concern continued\nduring his Mars and Rahu Maha Dashas, since all three grahas have\nstrong- associations with the sixth house of enemies in his chart. His\ndeath occurred in April 195 5 during the planetary period of Rahu-\nMoon. Rahu, who occupies Einstein's eighth house (death), will in",

When the bhukti\n of a debilitated graha who occupies a dussthana occurs during the\ndasha of a malefic who also tenants a dussthana, serious trouble is\nvery likely. This was reinforced by the fact that at the time of death\nRahu had returned by transit to its natal place, thereby reactivating\n its death-house position.\nF U R T H E R M O R E It is precisely because people are always performing\nkarmas that the natal chart is not always an accurate guide for\neverything that happens in life. Horary charts, omens and ishta\ndevatas can help indicate results which the natal chart fails to\nprovide. Since these investigations can also be performed in hind-\nsight, we decided to check the prashna (horary) chart for the\nmoment that this problem of Mars's fitness to deliver a Nobel Prize\nduring Einstein's Moon-Mars period occurred to us. In that prashna\non that Tuesday (the day of Mars) Mars occupied the lagna in\nScorpio, forming a Ruchaka Yoga from all three lagn~s.The Full\nMoon sat in the seventh house exalted, so that the Moon and Mars\ncreated a powerful Chandra-Mangala yoga.

Finally, and amazingly, Mars was the\noperating dasha lord in the prashna chart.\n A prashna of this brilliance suggests (at least in hindsight) that\nthe karma indicated at birth by the presence of both the Moon and\nMars in dussthanas had been altered in some way, either by some\nKriyamana Karma that Einstein had himself performed, or by\ngrace. Had Einstein consulted a jyotishi prior to or during his\nMoon-Mars period, perhaps this alteration could have been detected\nin foresight.",

Secondly, his horoscope has been re-\nsearched by many competent jyotishis who have found no need to\nquestion its authenticity. Thirdly, Ramakrishna's life, as reflected in\nhis birth chart, is a marvelous validation of many of the principles\nof Jyotish, as it should be for someone who showed such great\ncapacity for attunement with the divine.\nYOGAS Like Yogananda, the great renunciate Ramakrishna had a\nPravrajya Yoga in his birthchart, for in his navamsha the Moon\noccupies a sign of Mars and is aspected by Saturn. This combination\nis particularly strong because all the participating planets occupy\ngood houses in the navamsha. In addition, Ramakrishna's chart\npossesses two other almost completely formed spiritual yogas (Sbri-\nnatha Yoga and Virinchi Yoga; see Phaladipika 6:28-3 I) that in our\nopinion added to his spiritual success.\n The Pravrajya Yogas in Ramakrishna's horoscope are comple-\nmented by an extraordinary array of other yogas. These include a\nShasha Yoga, a Dharma Karma Adhipati Yoga, a Buddhaditya\nYoga, a Saraswati Yoga, a Durudhara Yoga, an Ubhayachari Yoga,\nand a host of more common yogas, including Chamara, Dhenu and\nChatra. The Shasha Yoga created by the exalted Saturn in the ninth\nbhava recurs, as do all the other yogas in this chart, from all three\nlagnas, since all three lagnas are in Aquarius. This particular Shasha\nYoga is very powerful because Saturn:\n(a) occupies Yuva Avastha, the best of the avasthas;\n(b) is exceptionally strengthened because its dispositor Venus is\n also exalted;\n(c) occupies Aquarius, its mdatrikona, in the navamsha;\n(d) is supported by the aspect of the natural benefic Jupiter, who\n acts exclusively as a benefic in this chart because it does not own\n any malefic bhavas;",

In this horoscope Saturn (renunciate\n tendencies) is the lord of the ascendant (general characteristics,\n including all-round success in life and renown) and of the twelfth\n bhava (renunciation, moksha), and it sits exalted in the ninth\n bhava (dharma, religion, higher knowledge). These indications com-\n bined in a potent confluence with the Pravrajya Yogas to make\n Ramakrishna a king among yogis.\n When we contrast this yoga with Marilyn Monroe's Shasha\n Yoga, which also gave her fame, we see that one of the meanings\n quoted for the yoga in her case was 'wicked in disposition . . .\n intrigues with women (or men) not his (her) own . . .' This meaning\n did not apply to Ramakrishna's life at all, partly because of the\n Pravrajya Yogas, which are conspicuously absent in Monroe's chart,\n partly because of the different planets and houses activated in the\n. two charts, and partly because of the condition of the grahas thus\n activated.\n In Monroe's chart Saturn owns the seventh bhava (desire) and\n the eighth bhava (infamous activities, including brazen sex), and\n occupies the fourth bhava (morals).

In Monroe's chart, Saturn influences\nboth the ascendant and the lord of her Sun Lagna, and both of the\n latter are without the moral influence of Jupiter. Saturn can, by its\noccupation of a rashi of Venus in both charts, create some concern\nover the native's morality. This concern in Ramakrishna's chart,\nalready alleviated by the foregoing considerations, becomes even\nless of a concern when we see that Venus has become particularly\nbenefic. Venus owns two good bhavas (being the Raja Yoga\nKaraka for all three of his lagnas) and occupies a rashi owned by\nthe noble-minded Jupiter. In Monroe's chart, this same dispositor\nof Saturn occupies a rashi of Mars, whence it aspects Saturn\nreciprocally as lord of another bhava of desire (the eleventh).\n Ramakrishna's Saraswati Yoga is extremely powerful and notewor-\nthy, since the grahas who create it - Venus, Jupiter and Mercury -\nare all powerful in the second bhava, a kona and a kendra respec-\ntively.

Although Mars's exaltation makes both this and\n the Durudhara Yoga valuable, Mars was less influential in Rama-\n krishna's life than was Venus because Mars does not participate in\nany other major yogas in the chart. The exalted Mars does, however,\nactivate the twelfth bhava of moksha, thus reinforcing the effects\npromised by the exaltation and the Shasha Yoga of the twelfth lord\n(who also happens to rule the lagna, which personalizes the effect).\n It is because of the presence of the Pravrajya Yogas and the other\nstrong spiritual themes in his horoscope that we do not interpret\nthese combinations in typically mundane ways. These spiritual\ninfluences caused, for example, Venus's strength as fourth lord to\nappear in his life as strong moral development instead of as a Rolls\nRoyce, and caused Mars's strength in the twelfth house to contribute\nto moksha and not to highly speculative investments in real estate.\n Among the twenty-four Yogas referred to in Chapter Ten, the\nauspicious yoga for the ascendant known as Chamara Yoga is created\nbecause the first house is aspected by the powerfully benefic Jupiter,\nwhile its lord Saturn is strongly situated in a kona.

In particular, he was\n an ascetic engaged in strong devotional practices. This signification\n especially came to the fore because the ascetically inclined Saturn\n rules the lagna.

While fourth lord Venus is exalted in the second house,\nwhich would suggest education, the education planets Mercury and\nJupiter fail to influence the fourth bhava, and so fail to support this\ninterpretation. This exaltation of the fourth lord is more likely to\nhave produced exalted happiness, for example, which the fourth\nbhava also represents.\n Ramakrishna's chart shows the beneficial fifth-house combination\ncalled Chatra Yoga, which is supposed to give keen wit, intelligence,\nan ability to give good advice, and also children (all fifth-house\nmatters). The Pravrajya Yogas make children unlikely, an interpreta-\ntion which is compounded by the presence of the ~ignificato~of\nchildren in the house of children (according to Principle of Interpre-\ntation j).

This is\n precisely the combination that creates Chatra Yoga, which is also\n said to produce powerful disciples; in fact, another meaning for\n Chatra is 'pupil'. That Ramakrishna would produce a brilliant\n disciple is suggested by Jupiter and Mercury, the two mental and\n educational planets which form the Chatra Yoga. They are particu-\n larly strong for this purpose because they reinforce one another,\n since Jupiter occupies a rashi of Mercury while also aspecting\nMercury. This sort of strong reciprocal relationship is called in\n Sanskrit sambandba.\n On rotating the horoscope to make Gemini, Ramakrishna's fifth\nhouse, into the ascendant of the disciple's chart thus created, we\nfind Mercury, lagna lord of this new chart, involved in a powerful\nBudhaditya Yoga in the ninth bhava. The strength of Mercury in\nthe ninth house suggests that this disciple would travel the world,\nwhile Saturn, the lord of the ninth bhava in the student's chart, is\nexalted in the ninth from that ninth (see Bbauat Bbauam in Chapter\nSix).

Few jyotishis are likely to have foreseen the unusual circum-\n stances surrounding his marriage, though a gifted Tantric jyotishi\nwith some siddhi (superhuman ability) might in a moment of inspira-\n tion have been able to do so. No matter how perfectly we may be able\nto engineer Jyotish's principles, they must always be empowered by\nthe consciousness of the jyotishi.\n The spiritual bhavas of Ramakrishna's chart (the ninth and\ntwelfth) dominated much of his life. These two houses are really\nhouses of potential spirituality; they take on this meaning only when\nthe general tenor of the horoscope suggests a spiritual theme, as for\nexample when Pravrajya Yogas exist. Otherwise, these two houses\nusually represent more prosaic matters. In Ramakrishna's case,\nauspicious spiritual karmas of a fixed nature prevailed for a variety\nof reasons. Two of these are that the ninth bhava contains the\nexalted lagna lord Saturn, whose dispositor is also exalted; and that\nthe twelfth house contains an exalted planet whose dispositor is also\nexalted in, of all places, the ninth house.\n When a graha's body (deha) and soul (jiua) are both so mighty,\nsuperlative results for the matters of the houses involved become\ninevitable, particularly because nvne of the planets involved is\nweakened by the influence of malefics, and because Saturn is\nsupported by the strong aspect of the exclusively benefic Jupiter.\nBecause striking combinations like these, desirable or undesirable,\ndisplay karma which is clearly fixed, we can confidently assert that\nRamakrishna was born ripe to experience his spiritual insights.\n Although we might also conclude that his powerful ninth house\nshould have given Ramakrishna a great deal of foreign travel, he\nnever left India. The main reason for this state of affairs is probably\nthat all three of his lagnas occupy a fixed rashi (Aquarius), which\ngave a fixity to his life. The travel effect was felt closer to home,\nhowever, in that he made long-distance (for that era, in which travel\nwas often difficult) pilgrimages, a variety of travel which is most\nappropriate both for the ninth house itself and for the overall\nspiritual nature of his horoscope.\nD A S H A S A N D B H U K T I S Ramakrishna was born with some I 3 years",

This chart illustrates beautifully\nhow important it is to enjoy a beneficial dasha at the appropriate\ntime in one's life.\n One interesting verification of our conclusion that Ramakrishna\nwas born with Dridha Karma for spiritual life occurred during his\nSaturn Maha Dasha. In late 1864 Ramakrishna met one of his\nteachers, Tota Puri, who instructed him in Advaita Vedanta and in\nthe practice of formless ecstasy (niruikalpa samadhi), a state that\neludes many aspirants even after a lifetime of keen practice. Rama-\nkrishna achieved this state in one day, for he was a spiritual\nprodigy, just as Mozart was a musical prodigy. The strong spiritual\nplacement of the planet Saturn enables us to predict that such\nresults would be enjoyed during his Saturn Maha Dasha.\n Ramakrishna actually attained to niruikalpa samadhi during his\nSaturn-Rahu period. Rahu as a bhukti lord will mainly give the\neffects of its dispositor Venus, the exalted lord of the ninth bhava\nwho is the strongest of the grahas which influence Rahu. Bhukti\nlord Rahu was transiting dasha lord Saturn's natal position in the\nninth bhava at the time of this experience, and Saturn himself had\nreturned to its exalted natal position to reinforce by transit what he\nhad promised natally.

While many classical authorities aver that a strong\nlagna and lagna lord create longevity, they also suggest that for\nlongevity the lagna should not be afflicted by the lord of the eighth,\nand that ideally the lord of the lagna and the lord of the eighth\nshould be of equal strength. Although the lagna and its lord are\nvery strong in this chart, all of the lagnas are simultaneously\nafflicted by the presence of Mercury, the eighth lord. Also the lagna\nlord is stronger than the eighth lord in all three lagnas. This is one\nof the factors that contributed to Ramakrishna's relatively early\ndeath at the age of yo.\n Let us now consider, as a final contributor to the confluence of\nspiritual placements in his chart, that Ramakrishna was born in the\nsoli-lunar yoga called Siddha ('Accomplished') Yoga, which gives an\naccommodating personality, a pleasant nature and an interest in\nritual and spirituality. Although the soli-lunar Yogas are a general\ninterpretation, in Ramakrishna's chart this general interpretation\nenhances those other combinations which promised great spiritual-\nity. Those who know Jyotish in its larger context of Indian spirituality\nknow that the term siddha is also used to refer to a spiritual adept,\nand they would work this connection into the interpretation. They\nwould not, however, try to work in the attributes of Duitiya\nTithi, under which Ramakrishna was born, for none of them seems\nto apply to him.

By being\ninvolved in multiple yogas in Nin's chart Saturn gains the same sort\n of prominence and strength that Mercury gains in Einstein's chart.\nHere Saturn is involved in the Shasha, Sunapha, Voshi and Parvata\nYogas, and in the two important and strong Dharma Karma\nAdhipati Yogas (the combination of the lords of houses I and 5 and\n I o and 5). Mercury, who is involved in almost as many yogas in this\nchart, is less influential than Saturn because Saturn occupies his\nown rashi.\n These two grahas effectively divided Nin's life into two portions:\nsuffering (Saturn) and writing (Mercury). Factoring in the meanings\nof the bhavas owned and occupied by these two grahas provides a\nfurther summation of her life: first lord Mercury (characteristics,\nsuccess, position in society) who is also tenth lord (career) occupies\nthe fifth bhava (poetry, books and authorship, which happen to be\nsome of Mercury's indications) conjoined with fifth lord Saturn.\nSuch a yoga logically provides a successful career in writing with a\nprominent position in society on this account.\n The Shasha Yoga is powerful, even though it does not recur\nfrom other lagnas, because Saturn is unafflicted by any malefic and\noccupies Yuva Avastha, its most powerful avastha. Most impor-\ntantly, though, its power comes from its simultaneous participation\nin powerful Sunapha and Voshi Yogas which occur in its own\nrashi, in good houses from the lagna.

We will consider here the simpler, Jaimini method, particu-\n larly because the same results are obtained by the Parashari method.\nJaimini says: Whenyou count the number of rashis the lagna lord has gone\nfrom the lagna, and then count that same number again from the lagna lord,\n in the natural direction of the constellations, the result is the A rudha L.agna.\n We examine the Arudha Lagna as if it were another birth chart.\nWhile certain yogas are read exclusively from this chart, according\nto the Jaimini system of yogas, most of the standard principles of\ninterpretation already introduced in this book can also be applied to\nthe Arudha Lagna chart. In the horoscope above, lagna lord Mer-\ncury sits in Sagittarius, which is the seventh rashi away from the\nlagna, Gemini. If we now count seven rashis (always inclusive!)\nfrom Sagittarius, we return to Gemini. In this case, therefore, the\nlagna and the Arudha Lagna are one and the same (as it will also be",

In this man's chart the\nvirulent malefic combinations therefore recur even from this lagna.\nThe lagna and Arudha Lagna were identical in the horoscopes of\nHitler and Gandhi as well, which in their cases reinforced the effects\nof their already power-packed birth charts.\n This process can then be extended to any of the bhavas of the\nhoroscope. Take for example the eleventh house, which is Aries in\nthe chart under consideration here. Its lord Mars occupies Scorpio,\nthe eighth rashi from Aries. Counting eight rashis from Scorpio, we\nobtain Gemini, the lagna. The condition of the lagna will now act\nto corroborate the results we can expect in the native's eleventh-\nhouse matters, including older brothers and sisters. Since we have\nalready seen the severe afflictions to which Gemini and its lord\nMercury are subjected, it comes as no surprise that he had no elder\nbrother.\n Finally, note that this man was, like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa,\nborn under the soli-lunar Siddha Yoga. While this yoga contributed\nto Ramakrishna's accommodating personality, pleasant nature and\ninterest in ritual and spirituality, it did nothing of the kind for this\nman. Being a soli-lunar yoga, it was not destroyed by the bhanga, as\nthe graha yogas were; it was instead submerged by the high tide of\nmalefics which swamped his life.",
