It is\n\ngenerally said by the astrological pandits that malefics do good if they are posited\n\nin the 6th house. The reason for this can be that the 6th house is 'Shatru sthana'.\n\nMalefics will destroy the enemies. It is also believed that Mars, Saturn and Rahu\n\nare good in the 3rd, 6th and 11th. The reason for this is also the same, namely, the\n\nmalefic will destroy enemies and diseases. Now we come to Shri Mantreshwarar's\n\nviews. According to him the lord of a house gives good effects when he is vested\n\nwith strength. This is unobjectionable but he has also expressed the opinion that if\n\nlord of a Dusthana is posited in another dustnana he does good. This has been\n\ndescribed in Verse 57 of this very chapter.

As the\n\nlongitude of 13°-12' in Cancer, it has passed the fourth quarter of Punarvasu in this\n\nsign and is in Pushyami nakshatra. To find out how much it has moved in\n\nPushyami we will deduct 3°-20' of Punarvasu from the Moon's 13°-12'. Thus the\n\nbalance will come to 9°-52'. The extent of the whole of Pushyami is 13°-20'. The\n\nlord of this nakshatra is Saturn whose total dasa period is 19 years. Therefore 13°-\n\n20' being equal to 19 years, 9°-52' will be equal to 14 years 0 months of 22 days.\n\nThis indicates that the 14 years and 22 days are observed over at birth and that\n\nwould remain at credit at birth will be 19 years minus 14 years 22 days, that is, 4\n\n All these detailed calculations will be avoided if we obtain the balance of\n\ndasa at birth on the longitude by referring to ready made tables in Lahiri's annual\n\n 4.

For\n\nexample, in the dasa of the Sun there will be the antar dasas of the Sun and all the\n\nother planets. The first antar dasa is of the same planet who is the lord of the dasa.\n\nFor example, in the dasa of Jupiter the order of antar dasas will be Jupiter, Saturn,\n\nMercury, Ketu, Venus, the Sun, the Moon, Mars and Rahu.

The period of antar dasa in a dasa should be calculated by the rule of\n\nthree. Suppose if we have to know the duration of antar dasa of the Sun in the dasa\n\nof Venus we should proceed as explained below. In 120 years the Sun's portion is\n\nof 6years. In 1 year the Sun's portion will be (6/120)*1. Therefore, in 20 years the\n\nSun will have Antar Dasa of (6*1/120)*20 = 1 year.\n\n The Sun's dasa is of 6 years and the dasa of Venus is of 20 years. Therefore\n\nthe figures of 20 and 6 have been taken above. The pratyantar dasa in any case can\n\nalso be calculated in the same manner.

Last four\ndenote following qualities, viz. Dharma / Tapas / fame / gain / Moksha. In fact, these four Rasis represent\nDharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.

A mutual\nParivartana – interchange, aspect or conjunction between these two Grahas will mean establishment of a cordial\nrelation between Brahmin and outcast.

In this\nconnection, it will be apt to quote following Sloka:\n\nViewing from another aspect, Guru is a Graha representing happiness, while Sani represents misery – II-5, 7.\nGuru denotes holy places, while Sani stands for filth etc. A cordial relation between two will naturally prove\nexistence of an impartial viewing of all things in native.\n\nAgain, Guru is supposed to be Amaraguru or preceptor of Gods, and so can be understood to represent\nNarayana, that is Vishnu. In every Siva temple in India, idol of Sani – Saniswara is inevitable. Therefore, it will\nnot be mistake if one were to conclude that Sani represents Hara.

He calls Graha foremost in Kalas degrees in any Rasi a Atmakaraka, next in degree to\nAtmakaraka as Atmatyakaraka and next as Bhratrukaraka, next as Matrukaraka and next as Putrakaraka, next\nas Jhatikaraka and next as Darakaraka. With this he stops and bases his prediction on these. This theory of\nattributing Karakatva is like attributing a Lagna to Atmakaraka and successive Bhavas till 7th to successive\nGrahas. In fact, this is how he has dealt with the subject. For details, please refer to Jaimini Sutras.\n Section V\n\nSloka 1 – 1 ½\nFollowing are what first Bhava represents: (1) body, (2) limbs (happiness and misery), (4) old age, (5)\nknowledge, (6) birth place, (7) fame, (8) dream, (9) strength, (10) dignity, (11) politics, (12) longevity, (13)\ntranquility, (14) age, (15) hair, (16) appearance, (17) pride, (18) livelihood, (19) gambling for others, (20) stigma,\n(21) honor, (22) skin, (23) sleep, (24) proficiency, (25) appropriating other’s money, (26) tendency to insult other\nmen, (27) freedom from disease, (28) discontent, (29) nature, (30) agency, (31) perseverance in breeding of cattle,\n(32) loss of decorum, and (33) blame from one’s castemen.\n\n   Uttara Kalamritam by Kalidasa Edited by Chistabo, May 2012   ",

The Vedic\nseers considered the Jyotish Shastra, which dealt with the knowledge\nof the future, as an important limb of the Vedas. The antiquity of the Vedas\nthemselves is lost in archaic times and any effort to fix their origin is\nbeyond human capability. The authorship of the various scriptures is\nattributed to several different seers, but none of them clained originality.\nThey merely recorded the wisdom they had heard or remembered. Time\nhas not tarnished their work. During the course of human civilization the\nintellectual horizon of mankind has expanded and new lights have\nbegun to shine from the ancient wisdom. With every new revelation, the\nancient wisdom becomes yet more profound. But as yet, we have not\nsucceeded in identifying the original foundation upon which the\nsuperstmcture was raised, or the eternal spring from which these drops\nof nectar are drawn.\n Vedic astrology is not inductive. Its principles are not founded solely\nupon celestial mechanics by way of which generalizations can be made\nfor application to posterity. Vedic astrology reflects the understanding and\nperception of ancient spiritual teachers regarding the facts of life. If the\nreceiving instrument was not perfect and the reflecting medium free from\nevery distortion, the understanding of this mysterious life-process could\nnot be everlasting. Even when perception was free from any bias, the\nimparting of the knowledge had to be very carefully accomplished.\nEspecially when the wisdom had to be transmitted over a long period of\ntime, the language had to be such that the impact of tine was minimal\nOnly a language which arose from the very nature of the objects and\nrelationships it was designed to express could be useful in this regard.

Generally, a student interprets or bends the wisdom to suit and\nfit his own experience, understanding, and psychological propensities.\n The ancient seers did not inquire merely out of intellectual curiosity.\nThey wanted to understand the laws of nature so that they could adapt\nthemselves to these laws and enlighten the paths of other seekers.

During the course of worldly evolution and the emer-\ngence of individualized human souls, different kinds of concretization\ntake place, both in the individual as well as in the manifested universe.\nBut the basic link is never severed. The different houses in the natal chart\nand the planetary connections with the houses reflect these eternal rela-\ntionships, and are the basis upon which the nature of the individual, his\ncourse of enfoldment, and the direction towards which his life is moving\ncan be known.

In fact,\nin modem times there is a great desire for scientific inquiry into the\nrationale of stellar relationships.\n\n Carl C. Jung, the eminent psychologist, explained astrology in very\nsimple words. He said, \"We are bom at a given moment, in a given place,\nand, like a vintage year of wine, we have the qualities of the year and of\nthe season in which we are bom. Astrology does not lay claim to anything\nmore.\" This principle is a source of great enlightenment and may even\nopen new lines of intellectual inquiry which could clear many of the\ncobwebs from the mind of modern man.",

It may be defmed as a\nmap of the sky and the planets at a certain moment, typically the moment\nof a person's birth. The planets move along the path of the ecliptic (the\napparent path of the sun against the stars). To specify their positions at the\ntime of birth, or at any moment of time, a reference point is needed to\nidentify the position of the planets in relation to the earth. This reference\npoint is the point of intersection between the path of the ecliptic and the\nequatorial horizon. But due to the retrograde motion of the equinoctial\npoints along the ecliptic, these points intersect earlier in each successive\nsidereal year. Thus, over a number of years, the precise position of these\ncoordinates becomes difficult to ascertain. The rate of precession is now\nidentifiable; however, this aspect of the problem is very complex and has\ngiven rise to different schools of astrology. For the present, it is sufficient\nto note that the horoscope cast for one's birth is a charting of the planetary\npositions in the sky at that exact moment.\n\n When examining any horoscope, it is important to realize that plane-\ntary positions are gauged in relation to both the zodiacal signs and the\nasterisms — i.e. further extensions of the ecliptic. When the planets are\ncharted in relation to the equinoctial points, they are naturally related to\nthese twelve signs of the zodiac and twenty-seven asterisms.

Eyes link\nthe beholder with the object perceived, the understanding of which\ndepends upon the state of the inner perceiver. Wealth of the type signified\nby this house arises not so much as a result of one's activities but a result\nof past karma; it comes from inheritance, property, interest accruals and\nsources over which the individual has no decisive control. Even the family\nrelations signified by this house refer to those relationships into which the\nperson is born and are distinctly different from relationships with siblings,\nthe mother, father, wife and others which are directly assigned to different\n\n2 Bythos (Greek). In Gnostic symbolic language, the Bythos is variously\n termed the Great Deep or Abyss of Profundity (see G. R. S. Mead,\n Fragments of a Faith Forgotten, University Books 1966). As Behari\n remarks, the liberal meaning Is \"depth.\"\n\nhouses. The human relations signified by this house refer to those contacts\nwhich form the close blood-ties (binding cultures and ethnicities). They\nare also formed from the karmic past. Thus one finds that the Second house\nrefers to creative potential as distinct from creative action, and that it links\nthe individual's life with one aspect of his eternal component. It is\nsignificant to note that the Second house refers as much to creative\npotential such as speech, etc., as it does to death.",

Generally, the Eighth\nhouse is related to longevity, death, the rectum and its diseases, but there\nis much more to this house than the standard interpretation implies. It will\nbe better understood if the relation between the Eighth house and the\nSecond, Sixth, and Twelfth is examined.\n The Second house, related to Om, is intimately linked with the\ncreative impulse while the Sixth, represented by Shakti or Mahamaya,\ncontains the six primary forces of Nature in germinal form. The Eighth\nhouse symbolizes the chakras or hidden organs of man through which the\nKundalini Shakti or Serpent Power flows. Esoterically, this house refers\nto the Vishnu aspect of creation, Vishnu implying expansion. The Eighth\nhouse is thus the storehouse of expansive energy latent in the microcosm.\nThe Twelfth house represents life after death and is related to the Pancha\nMahabhutam or five basic elements. In a way, the Twelfth house is a\nsymbol for water functioning as the universal solvent of the alchemists\nIn fact, that is what death does: it reduces everything to its ultimate\nconstituents.\n\n Seen against the background of the four mystic houses, one can realize\nthat the Eighth house represents the hidden aspects of one's life.

Thus the Eighth house symbolizes the powers in Nature\nembodied as the Kundalini Shakti. All these spring from the Great Deep,\nthe Bythos which exists forever.

As it proceeds on its material path, the soul meets with\nresistance. The nature of this opposing force is also an aspect of the eternal\ncomponent of existence. Thus the Sixth house shows struggle, difficulties,\nopposition of various Idnds, litigation and servitude. Through these\nexperiences, however, the individual develops his latent spiritual powers.\nWhen diseases and difficulties depress the individual, he gains strength\nby overcoming his depression. Exoterically, therefore, the Sixth house\nrepresents fear, difficulties, enemies, ill health, debt, servitude and the\nfear of death. Essentially it is the house of difficulties.",

They cannot bear humiliation. Under favorable conditions\n\nthey can have much spiritual insight and possess hidden knowledge of the\nfiner forces of Nature. The Mercurial intellect, benefic as well as malefic,\nis in affinity with Ashlesha.\n Ashlesha imparts intellectual and mental development and enables its\nbeneficiaries to undergo radical transformations in life — transformations\nwhich occur in the most unexpected manner. Afterwards, an entirely\ndifferent condition of existence prevails.\n\n10. MAGHA\n Magha extends from 120° 00' to 133° 20' (0° 00' to 13° 20' Leo), the\nasterism is presided over by the Pitris, Vedic immortals considered to be\nthe progenitors of the human race; its planetary rulership is assigned to\nKetu, the mysterious descending node of the Moon.\n The primary guna, tamas, imparts inertia, while the secondary and\ntertiary attributes, rajas, suggest that one experiences great contradictions\nand an urge to make life purposeful. One aspect of Magha produces\ntremendously swift action, while other parts of it put the brakes to this\ntendency, directing the energy towards stasis. Such an interaction leads\nto psychological tension and a sense of frustration.",

The child\nborn of Shiva's semen was the only one who could kill a demon whose\n\npower lay in the fact that he could only be slain by a seven-day-old child\nof Shiva. Another story tells of how Shiva and Parvati undertook to find\nbrides for their two sons, Ganesh and Kartikeya Ganesh attained the\nmarriageable maidens by playing a trick. Disappointed, Kartikeya retired\nto the mountains to practice austerities. Two characteristics of Mars are\nemphasized here. First, Mars represents the creative fire which produces\ninvincible power. Second, Mars has a tremendous urge for marital rela-\ntionships but is denied the opportunity to consummate them.",

This change occurs due to a slight\nwobble in the earth's axis, and the motion thus created is called the\nprecession of the equinoxes.

Hindu astrologers allow for\nthe precession of the equinoxes. Their sidereal zodiac is called frxed,\nbecause it is constant against the background of the fixed stars and\nconstellations (i.e., the vernal point may move, but the zodiac itself does\nnot, since it is a collection of stars and constellations).\n\n Another important point is that the precession of the equinoxes\nmoves in retrograde motion (i.e., backward).

It is, in fact, about to pass over into Aquarius.\nThis is what Western astrologers mean when they say that we are entering\nthe Age of Aquarius.\n In order to convert a standard Western horoscope to a Hindu one,\ntherefore, we must subtract the difference in precessional motion from the\ntropical planetary positions given in Western charts.\n\n A }>ou5i--orl£ri|rj:j thart for Tlie ■flfcawri flurt ii hcu^e-orkfitd\n Qu^Hii1>: | (Asr^ IV (lilftunjTigfjMu.

For a birth date in 1986, it will be necessary to subtract a larger\nnumber of degrees and minutes than for a birth date in 1924.\n\n Western sidereal astrologers use an ayanamsha developed by Cyril\nFagan and Donald Bradley.

The procedure, then, is to convert the tropical longitudes of the\nWestern chart into sidereal longitudes.\n The easiest way to make this conversion by hand is to consider all\nzodiacal positions as portions of the 360° circle. This allows us to render\nany longitudinal position into numbers.\n\n Let us take, as an example, the following birth data: February 19,\n1940, at 6:45 p.m. in Jersey City, New Jersey (74W04, 40N44). The\nWestern or tropical version of this horoscope, whether calculated by hand\nor by computer, will look like this (Fig. 8):\n\n 1 For the benefit of readers living in India, or for the few Westerners lucky\n enought to possess Lahiri's Emphemeris, the complete system of Vedic\n horoscope calculations is included in the Appendix.",

However, a Porphyry\nTable of Houses is not easy to come by.

Rectification of horoscopes according to various estabhshed\n practices.\n\n3 In Hindu astrology, a planet which occupies 0° or 29° of any sign is\n considered powerless or debilirated.\n4 Rectification is the art of determining an exact birth-time from inexact\n data.\n\n 5.

Motional strength refers to retrogradation\nor otherwise of the planet. Under these conditions, the normal influence\nof a planet is subtly altered. The natural strength of each planet depends\nupon its inherent quality. The value assigned to each planet depends upon\nits luminosity, which has been assigned differently for different planets.\nThe aspects depend upon the angular positions of planets as well as the\naffinity existing between them. We shall examine all these factors before\nwe attempt to show how they are evaluated.\n\n Zodiacal signs are zones of influence.

Even in such descriptions, casual hints are given which\nreveal the deeper implications of the house. The Sixth house is associated\nwith \"cooked rice,\" intense anguish, \"receiving alms,\" \"a fall from a boat,\"\nand urinary troubles; it is also connected with the six flavors and prison.\nSome of these meanings are very simple and astrologers take their clues\nfrom this house when examining debts, litigation, service conditions,\ndiseases and the like, but when we come to such attributes as urinary\ntroubles, intense anguish, and receiving alms we are inclined to take them\nliterally, overlooking the symbolic use of these phrases. The cooked rice,\nreceiving of alms, six flavors and the fall from a boat are concealed\nreferences to certain stages of the initiation process. The Sixth house\nshould in fact be considered as the Great Illusion, Maya, which veils the\nreal nature of the Eternal: debts, diseases, and servitude are mere outer\nexpressions of the outflow of karmic forces. The Sixth house conceals\nwithin itself the potential energy which ultimately grows into limitless\nsplendor provided the veil of illusion is removed. During the process of\nremoving the veil, the individual must pass through troubles and tribula-\ntions; he has to fight with himself and his limitations.

The combination of any planet with the\nlords of the houses comprising the Mysterious Depth, or the placement of\nthe lords of these houses wherever they may be in the natal chart, is a\nwarning signal; the results, even if favorable, are not an unmitigated boon.\nFor example, the lord of the Sixth placed in the Second will make the\nnative fortunate in his family, a good orator, affluent, dutiful, and the\nresident of a foreign country, but his wealth and renown will not be\nacquired smoothly; there may be scandal and litigation involved. The lord\nof the Sixth in the Sixth will produce enmity with one's own people while\nothers, especially foreigners, may be very friendly and helpful. The lord\nof the Eighth in the Second makes the individual less affluent, but also\nenables him to retrieve lost property. In the Sixth, the lord of the Eighth\nenables the native to vanquish his enemies. The lord of the Eighth in the\nEighth house increases longevity but makes the native a thief and a person\nwho is ungrateful to his teacher.

But its unifying\nrole, whereby all our activities are centralized and directed toward the\nprimary goal of life, is seldom realized. In the early stages of human\ngrowth and develop-ment, the solar energy permits the individual a great\ndeal of latitude. Under such conditions, the problem of integration is not so\nimportant. Only at a later stage, when the individual has gathered\nexperience and acquired strength and karmic merit, does the question\nof unifying his various sheaths arise. Having appreciated the need for\ncontrol of the mind and emotions, the task of cleansing the astro-mental\nsheaths becomes acute. This raises the issue of the Moon in its obvious\nas well as its esoteric implications. Then arises the urge for knowledge of\nthe secrets of Nature, the desire for initiation, and the attraction to\nspiritual studies which indicate that the solar radiance has begun its\noperation: the unifying process has begun.",

It is not restricted or reflected by any other house division.\nApplying the rule, the Ascendant is the frrst house from itself, therefore\nno other house is involved in deciphering its results. However, the\nAscendant is seventh from the Seventh house, so the significance of the\nSeventh must be examined in relation to the disposition of the First\nhouse. Thus the apex of the Spiritual aiangle (First house) influences\nthe apex of the Mangle of Materiality (Seventh house). The depths in\nwhich the individual may immerse himself are directly linked to the\nheights toward which he may aspire. The potentiality contained in the\nSeventh house can fructify only with the approval of the First house. The\nSeventh represents partnership, whether in marriage or in business; it is\nalso linked with death, dissipation of energy, and sexual pleasure. These are\nthe basic impulses of the Seventh house, though according to the present\nrule it will also reflect the qualities of the Fourth house, as it is the fourth\nfrom the Fourth. The Seventh is also the tenth from the Tenth, hence it\nsignifies the results of the Tenth house as well. In relation to the First\nhouse, it is difficult to say how much of the S Seventh house will be\nreflected by the First, because the First house epitomizes the entire\nhoroscope; nonetheless the basic fact remains that the First house does\nreflect some basic urges of the Seventh. Considering sexual relationships\nand sociability as the essential impulses flowing from the Seventh, the\ndisposition of the First house must be potent enough to enable the\nfructification of these Seventh house impulses. For instance, if Venus is in\nLibra in the Seventh while Mars in Aries is in strength in the First, the\nindividual will have lustful urges and a great desire for amiable social\nrelationships, but Mars will make the First house so antagonistic to the\nsocial and sexual impulses of the Seventh house that these basic urges of\nthe individual will be stifled. On the other hand, with Scorpio as the\nSeventh house and Venus in Taurus in the First, the individual may feel\nan inward repugmance toward sex and social relationships, yet he will be\ncompelled by circumstances into just such situations. He would be psy-\nchologically averse to what he is doing physically.

Basically, it involves\nthe planet which rules the debilitation sign of the planet involved or the\nplanet which rules the sign in which the fallen planet would be exalted.\nThe most important variation involves three conditions.

Jyotish, then, literally\nmeans the Lord of light, with special reference to the Sun, Moon,\n stars and planets. It is a science of the study of heavenljr lights and\n their effects on human life. A t m a b o t i Parama Dhanla means that\natma (the soul) or pure awareness is also the light, and that one\nshould seek to attain that light of life with the help of Jyotish.\nJyotish helps to achieve the four main goals of human life: dharma\n(religious merit), artha (acquiring wealth), kama (worldly enjoyment)\nand moksha (liberation). It governs not only individual life, but\nglobal affairs as well. The study of the influence of light on every\nliving and non-living thing is the science of Jyotish. The word\n'astrology' has the same roots: 'astro' refers to the stars (the source\nof light) and 'logos' science. Everything in the universe is moving\nand changing, and that which is moving is bound by time. Stars are\nluminous bodies radiating energy into space. The rays of light:\nthen, come from the stars and planets, which are surrounded by\ntheir own magnetic and gravitational fields influencing this light.\nThc Earth, thcn, receives this light. According to ancient jyotish\nshastra (scriptures), Saturn is the most distant planetary body influ-\nencing the Earth, and the Moon is the nearest. The Sun is considered\nthe soul of our solar system. These light energies coming from the\nSun, Moon, planets and stars all separately influence the physical,\nenvironmental, mental and spiritual status of all beings. This light\nalso affects the dark recess of distant future. (Just consider the fact\nthat the light from many stars began its journey millions of years\nago.)

    "output": "the heavenly bodies in order to foretell the future of individuals and\n the fate of nations, empires, kingdoms, wars, revolutions and other\n terrestrial events.\n Jyotish believes that man is a creation of the cosmos. From the\n A.yzirvedic standpoint, every human being has a unique body type,\n called p r a k r h . Jyotish also believes that everyone has a unique\n planetary constitution. This combination governs the entire psycho-\n somatic make-up of an individual. The unique combination of every\n individual depends entirely upon the specific time and place of\nphysical birth. So it is very important to check in the ktfndali\n (astrological chart) for personal compatibility before marriage, in\norder to bring clarity, communication and success in marital life.\nPeople should platl well in advance for conception, building a house\nor beginning any auspicious work according to the most favorable\nplanetary positions.\n Just as imbalance of bodily dosha causes disease, likewise the\nundesirable effect of certain planets can become a causative factor in\nill-health. According to Ayzirveda, every individual has seven bodily\ntissues, and according to Jyotish they are influenced by the different\nplanets. For instance, the Sun influences consciousness and eyes, the\nMoon governs the mind, Mercury the intellect, and Jupiter super-\nvises knowledge. Mars is related to the blood and liver, Saturn rules\nthe neuro-muscular systems. Venus governs the reproductive system\nand artistic talent. Jyotish can be studied under several different\naspects: astro-physiology, psychology, etiology, pathology, symp-\ntomatology and therapeutics. like any other Vedic discipline, the\nstudy of Jyotish needs the guidance and blessings of a guru (one\nwho has mastered the subject) in order to have the insight to read\nand interpret the Jyotish chart. It is a wonderful healing science\nwhich can suggest certain stones, gems, crystals and metals in order\nto balance the undesirable effects of the planets. Jyotish also advises\nfasting on certain days to lessen these negative effects. It can also\nrecommend a proper mantra, aspect of God to worship, yagya (fire\nceremony) and certain spiritual rituals in order to neutralize karmic\nand planetary effects.\n In the true sense of the word, the science of Jyotish embraces the\nwhole human being in order to bring health, happiness and harmony",

We\nforfeit our opportunities in life, be they ever so sterling, by being in\nthe right place at the wrong time or in the wrong place at the right\ntime. Each of us is, therefore, naturally drawn toward a greater\nunderstanding of the time and the space in which we live, that we\nmay better know who we arc, where we come from, and where we\nare going. One of the yardsticks that we can use to measure our\ntime and space is divination, which is discovery of the 'unknown'\nby using chains of cause and effect which are not always evident to\nthe objective observer.\n Jjoti~h(literally, 'Light'; by extension, 'the Study of Light') is\nIndia's system of divination. Sometimes referred to, especially out-\nside India, as Hindu or Vedic astrology, Jyotish is a model of reality\nwhich interprets the observed conditions of the cosmos at the time\nof an event in order to provide insight into the nature of that event.\nBecause models merely represent the reality of an experience, they\ncan at best guesstimate it; they can neither portray it with perfect\naccuracy nor infallibly predict it. The better a model, the more\nreliable ~ t srepresentation of reality. Whenever a model ceases to\nreflect reality adequately, it must be refined. India alone among the\nworld's great civilizations has developed, refined and maintained\nmany different divinatory models during its long history. Its various\nastrologies have over time been combined and transmuted into a\nfascinating and intricate, living discipline.",

On the contrary,\nJyotish is a more universally applicable model than' are many other\nforms of divination. Jyotish can easily adapt to Western conditions,\n just as foreign therapies such as acupuncture have adapted, provided\nits general principles are systematically understood.\n This book will give you a sound theoretical basis in Jyotish.\nExperimentation can provide you with personal experience, and if\nyour experience should draw you to the path of Jyotish as a way of\nlife you can then begin the practical training which can be had only\nby apprenticing with a traditional practitioner of Jyotish.

This book\nnecessarily retains much original Sanskrit terminology because some\nSanskrit words and concepts simply do not translate directly into\nEnglish. Jyotish has its own rigorously defined technical vocabulary\nwhich permits the quick and precise comparing of the astrological\nequivalents of apples and pears, and it is much easier to learn a few\nsimple words like graha, rashi and bhava than it is constantly to\ninvent them in English.

Contemporary researchers, being\ngenerally suspicious of oral transmissions of knowledge, look for a\nculture's written records, believing that oral history deteriorates\ninto myths and legends.

The Sanatana Dharma is eternal because it\nsprouts vigorous new growth whenever one of the saints or seers\nwho are its inspired founders receives new inspiration from the One\nAbsolute Reality.

Because inaccuracies were inevitable in the early days, the\n.Yzrr_ya Siddhanta advises jyotishis to use regular observations to\nconfirm the accuracy of predicted planetary motions.\n\n Natal Astrology (Jataka)\nThe relating of the position of the planets at an individual's time\nand place of birth with the various events in that person's life\n(which is known as birth or natal astrology in English and as jataka\norjanma in Sanskrit) is what is usually meant by the term 'astrology'.\nMost of what appears in this book is natal astrology.\n\n Horar_y Astrology (Prashna)\nHorary astrology investigates the correlation of planetary phenom-\nena at the time a question is asked with the answer to that question.",

After these rishis had produced\na river of such birthcharts, the gods, alarmed at this challenge to\ntheir omniscience, sent a great fire which destroyed most of the\ncollection.

Our experience tends to bear this out. When complete, a Nadi\nreading traditionally consists of four parts: the first, known as bhava\nphala, deals with issues like career, marriage, children, health and\nfinances. The second, yoga khanda, gives precise predictions, usually\ninvolving political, social or scientific attainments, based on certain\nplanetary combillations found in that horoscope.

One curious fact: while a Nadi\n reading is often strikingly precise regarding one's past, predictions\n of the future rarely achieve the same success at detail, though they\n are usually broadly accurate.",

In fact, neither Tantric\n Jyotish nor Tantra, its parent, can be readily defined. Like Ayurveda,\n Tantra is said to be an offshoot of the Atharva Veda, the fourth of\n the four Vedas; but as yet no one has a clear idea of the origins of\n the Atharva Veda, a hymnal filled with occult chants and charms. In\n an astrological context the word 'Tantric' implies a mystical and\n intuitive attitude toward Jyotish. Tantra calls for 'sacrificial rites',\n and a practitioner of Tantric Jyotish tends to rely on internally\n derived information over that collected from external sources, arriv-\n ing at startling correct conclusions via magical techniques.\n These techniques include but are not limited to the observation\nand interpretation of omens; the observation and analysis of the\n jyotishi's breathing patterns at the moment a question is asked; the\ninterpretation of a client's speech-patterns and actions; the encourag-\ning of spontaneous or forced visions; clairvoyance, clairaudience, or\n astral travel; the use of information received from ethereal beings;\nthe use of substances or techniques to induce such paranormal or\npsychic phenomena as the charming of objects or people, past-life\nreadings, miraculous cures, and the granting of boons; and the use\nof intense spiritual practices to bring the powers of nature under\none's direct and personal control.\n Many systems of divination around the world also employ such\ntechniques, but few who do past-life readings or trance channeling\nare practicing Tantric Jyotish.

It is\nthis process of standardization and correlation which makes astrologi-\ncal the collection of shamanic techniques that is Tantric Jyotish. For\nexample, while omens may be interpreted in many ways, Jyotish\ntends to interpret them according to time (when they happen) and\nspace (where they happen). An omen which occurs in a westerly\ndirection is likely to cause a jyotishi to think first of Saturn, who\nrules the west, and then to consider Saturn's implications on the\nquestion at hand.",

Creation begins whenever the\nPurusha desires to experience Itself; that desire causes a sense of\nseparateness to arise, which is known as Prakriti, or Nature, and is\nthe womb of the manifested universe, the macrocosm.

In each human life the\n specific proportions of the Three Gunas determine, via the Nine\n Planets, that individual's aptitude for the various possible actions\n which a living human can perform.\n Though the Law of Karma is simply stated - 'as you sow, so\n shall you reap' - it is no simplistic, tit-for-tat theory, nor is it an\n arbitrary human creation. The Law of Karma is another name for\n Newton's Third Law of Motion: 'For every action there is an equal\n and opposite reaction.' As such, it is inherent in the universe's\n structure: 'The doctrine of karman and phala, act and fruit, is less a\n product of man's sense of justice, that one shall be punished for\n what one has done, than a necessary consequence of the doctrine of\n the inherent efficacy of the acts' (van Buitenen, p. j j).\n Everything does not happen all at once in our world, thanks to\n the inherent limitations of time, space and causation. A tree and the\n. seed from which it sprang cannot exist simultaneously; the former\n must develop from the latter. Events occur in our universe accord-\n ing to a sequence which is scheduled by the Law of Karma on the\n great calendar known as time.\n As soon as Prakriti separates from Purusha, the Law of Karma\n begins to operate, for everything that happens thereafter is ultimately\n due to that first act. Each action inexorably causes some effect, and\n each effect causes further effects, like ripples spreading from a rock\n pitched into a pool. As a myriad actions accumulate, the cascade of\n effects becomes exceedingly intricate and perplexing, embroiling us\n in extended matrices of cause and effect which bind us and the\n world together into a vast, self-regulating system. As Mahatma\n Gandhi is reported to have said, 'After inventing the Law of Karma\n God was able to retire.'\n In living individual beings the Law of Karma acts primarily at",

A good jyotishi, like a soothsayer, composes a well-tuned\nstory for a client, a story which creates an image of reality as it was\nin the past, as it is at the time of the reading, and as it may become\nin the future, according to the client's life goals.\n If, for example, the question is about marriage, and the natal\nhoroscope indicates Dridha-Adridha Karma, then the horoscope\ncalculated for the moment the question is put to the astrologer will\nreveal what energies have been activated by the individual with\nregard to marriage in the time between his or her birth and the\nasking of the question. As it happens, when a natal horoscope\nshows fixed karma in one area of life, the same sort of confluence of\nindications will usually be present when the same area is investigated\nvia the horary horoscope.\n Once a conclusion is drawn about the nature of the karmas in the\narea of life under investigation, muhurta (electional astrology) is used\nto maximize the effectiveness of the Kriyamana and Xgama Karmas\nselected for use as remedies, since muhurta is an astrological method\nfor optimizing free will. Nimitta (omenology) spontaneously en-\nhances natal, horary and electional astrology when they, due to\nkarmic complexities, cannot provide the detail necessary for making\neffective decisions. That unforeseen developments can occur in life\nis accommodated philosophically through the notion of kripa (divine\ngrace). In spite of all his disadvantages, a beggar can become a king\nif favored by grace, and kings can and do become beggars on falling\nfrom grace. Consideration of omens permits a jyotishi to take the\nfactor of grace (or its lack) into account when making an astrological\ninterpretation of a life.\n The particular complexity of influences with which a jyotishi",

While the averaged proper motion\nof Rahu and Icetu carry them backwards through the zodiac,\nsome modern writers have pointed out that, due to complex pertur-\nbations of the orbits of the Earth and the Moon, the invisible positions\nof the nodes sometimes move forward. Since classical Jyotish does\nnot mention this 'change' of motion, it is not regarded as the 'retro-\ngression' of the nodes.\n Retrogression always begins for the outer planets (Mars, Jupiter\nand Saturn) when Earth sits between them and the Sun. These\nplanets are always brightest, and therefore strongest, when they are\nnearly opposite the Sun in the sky, because it is then that we are\nclosest to them. Jupiter and Saturn move backwards once each year.\nMars is not as cyclical in his retrogression, which is one reason we\ncall him 'the Crooked' (vakrz). Vakri also happens to be the Sanskrit\nword for retrograde. Because Mars was observed to be independent\nin the skies, he gained a reputation for causing independence in the\nhoroscope. Here interpretation follows observation yet again.\n The situation for the inner planets (Mercury and Venus) is a bit\nmore complex. While Venus does not necessarily go retrograde each\nyear, Mercury retrogrades several times annually. Even though\nMercury's perceived motion is an average of I?' per day more than\nthat of the Sun or Venus, Mercury goes retrograde so often that,\nlike the Sun and Venus, it covers only one constellation every 30\ndays, on the average.",

Jyotish, which is a sort of\nlanguage, offers a variety of words and a series of basic rules which\ndictate when, where and how those words may be used. While an\neffective communicator may intuitively know when logical rules of\nword-selection can be broken, this sort of intuition works only\nwhen the communicator is well versed in the rules of the language.\n The words of the language of Jyotish are the planets, constella-\ntions and houses. Anyone who sets out to learn a new idiom must\nfollow the tedious but unavoidable procedure of acquiring a basic\nvocabulary by memorizing lists of words and their meanings. The\nnext three chapters of this book form a comprehensive vocabulary\nwhich must be memorized by anyone who hopes to become profi-\ncient in the language of Jyotish, because Jyotish is classically taught\nby proceeding from the specific to the abstract. First the student\nlearns specific examples, then the mentor helps the student to see\nthe theory from which those examples have originated. When you\nlearn specifics first, you rarely if ever forget them; the specifics will\nthen unfailingly remind you of their underlying principles.\n Many people who study Jyotish try to take shortcuts by learning\njust enough of the Jyotish vocabulary they believe to be essential\nand then trying to fill in the gaps with their knowledge of Western\nastrology. Such haphazard learning cannot prepare you adequately\nto speak in Jyotish's idiom any more than you could carry on an\nintelligible conversation in grammatical French if you chose to learn\nonly a fraction of French vocabulary and elected to substitute\nEnglish words for everything you had not bothered to absorb.

To translate the French expression 'monpetit\n C ~ O M ' into English as 'my little cabbage' is literally correct, but such\na literal rendering is absurd, for 'mon petit chom' is an idiomatic\nexpression which means 'my dear' or 'my darling'. 'Honey' may,\nhowever, be a good translation for 'man petit chon', even though\n'cabbage' does not mean 'honey'.\n Because of inherent ambiguities in everyday speech, even people\nwho are not professional translators must translate within their\nnative language much of the time. When someone tells you to 'hit\nthe nail with the hammer', you probably will not slug away at your\nfingernail, because you understand that a different sort of 'nail' is\nindicated. When you hear the phrase 'bull's-eye', you are not likely\nto visualize a bovine organ of sight, because your previous experi-\nence of the phrase helps you to interpret it appropriately.\n Proficiency in any language comes through experience but, by\ncomparing the many translations of the Bible, you will discover that\ndifferences of opinion can and do arise even among experienced\ntranslators. Several English possibilities exist for each of the most\nvital Greek or Hebrew words in critical passages, and each variant\ninterpretation is sanctioned by a rival group of reputable scholars.\nThis is precisely the situation among groups of jyotishis when they\ndebate pithy astrological statements, for, in the words of the Vedas,",

Although many people, particularly Westerners, take as\nunreal the mythic symbols which represent these events, Jyotish\ntreats them as being real both independently and dependently. They\nare dependently real in that they can remain alive on the material\nplane only so long as humans continue to remember them, and they\nare independently real in that they do not require humans in order\nto continue to live.

However, a small but significant group of\n jyotishis take Gemini and Sagittarius to be the exaltation and debil-\n itation constellations of Rahu, and Sagittarius and Gemini to be the\n exaltation and debilitation constellations respectively of Ketu.\n A very small group considers both Rahu and Ketu to be exalted\nin Scorpio and both to be debilitated in Taurus. This approach\nseems to be verified both by experience and by the logic of the\nscheme of exaltation. In this scheme the grahas form contrasting\npairs: Sun and Saturn, Moon and Rahu/Ketu (both nodes being the\nopposite ends of the same axis), Mercury and Venus, Mars and\nJupiter. For each pair of planets, the exaltation constellation of the\none becomes the debilitation constellation of the other, and vice\nversa. Within this framework it follows that the exaltation constella-\ntion of the Moon should be the debilitation constellation of both\nRahu and Ketu, and that the debilitation constellation of the Moon\nshould be the exaltation constellation of both Rahu and Ketu.\nThroughout this book it will be assumed that Rahu and Ketu are\nboth exalted in Scorpio and both debilitated in Taurus.\n A planet placed in its exaltation degree, or (practically speaking)\nin any other degree of its constellation of exaltation, attains its\nstrongest placement in a horoscope and so will exhibit its energies,\nfor good or evil, with great intensity. Exalted planets are not,\nhowever, always benevolent planets! Whether or not a graha will\ngive good results is determined by other indicators in the horoscope.\nAn exalted graha acting malevolently will cause exalted problems in\none's life, while a planet in its debilitation degree (or, effectively, in\nany other degree of its debilitation constellation) will express its\nenergies very feebly, because it has attained its weakest placement in\na horoscope. It may well be desirable for one's prosperity to have\ncertain planets debilitated (fallen) in one's chart, though certain\nmalefic grahas may actually become, for complex reasons, more\nmalign when fallen.",

A planet's latitude can be found in tabulated form in a\nPandarzga (an Indian ephemeris; see Chapter Seven), but this is\nusually missing from a Western ephemeris.\n Another group of methods for evaluating strength are collectively\nknown as graha avasthas ('planetary states' or 'conditions').

Jupiter and Mercury are the planets of intelligence\nand wisdom, and early morning is the very best time for study and\nmeditation, when the mind is fresh and clear. Sun and Mars, the\ntwo hottest planets, show their influence best at midday, the hottest\npart of the day.

The natural inclination of the Brabmana is to be immersed\nin philosophy, religion and altruistic service; that of the Ksbatrya is\nto concentrate on politics and rulership; the Vaishya's natural\naptitude is for trade and business; and the Sbudra naturally gravitates\ntowards service and manual labor.

Without such arcane procedures as the prana pratisbtba (the\n 'establishing of life'), few gemstones will give the sort of dramati-\n cally beneficial effects that the scriptures promise. While many\n people have read that the use of gemstones can radically improve\n their lives, most of them are unaware that, when used improperly,\n gemstones can disrupt their lives, particularly if they are worn\n without consideration for their possible effects.\n In particular, those who wear large, flawless diamonds or sap-\n phires must be very wary of potential calamities unless they are sure\n that those particular gems suit them. Both our gurus were extremely\nwary of the blue sapphire. On one occasion a man desiring to wear\na blue sapphire to increase his luck was told that neither he nor his\nmother might survive his wearing of the jewel. He insisted, how-\never, and tied the stone on his arm for seven days (which is one\napproved procedure for testing such a gemstone). After his mother\ndied suddenly within that week he promptly decided that the guru\nwas right, and he removed the gem. Nor was this some bizarre\ncoincidence; both authors have witnessed such events several times.\n In addition to all the above caveats, remember that, in the words\nof our jyotish guru, 'Gemstones are the game of kings.' Since a\ngemstone meant for use as a remedy must be flawless, of good color\nand of supreme luster, and must weigh at least three carats, such\nbaubles are very expensive. But a remedy should solve the problem,\nnot add to it. If you suggest an expensive remedy to a poor man, he\nwill become even more depressed for, while the promise of the\nremedy will tantalize him, it will remain forever outside his grasp.\nTo solve this problem, Jyotish also provides for tiparatnas ('substi-\ntute gemstones'). Although the zrparatnas are substantially weaker\nthan their precious counterparts, all the criteria of effectiveness that\napply to more valuable gemstones apply equally to the zipat-atnas.\nAmong these substitutes are:\nS U N rules garnet J U P I T E R rules citrine\nMOON rules moonstone VENUS rules white sapphire\nM A R S rules bloodstone S A T U R N rules lapis lazuli\nM E R C U R Y rules peridot or green R A H U rules agate\n tourmaline KETU rules turquoise",

The benejcs\ngenerally stand for qualities like growth, expansion and preservation,\nwhile the malefcs represent decay, restriction and destruction. Of\nthemselves these qualities are neutral, but from the human perspec-\ntive they are frequently characterized as being positive or negative.\nBoth sets of qualities are necessary; for one tree to grow strong and\ntall, many others must die in its shadow. Note that the malefic\nplanets outnumber the benefics. This is partly due to the fact that\nJyotish is a way of mapping karmas; since most people tend to\nperform those actions which they believe to be in their own self-\ninterest, the strongest karmas are frequently those which are most\nselfish, not the most altruistic. The more selfish an action is, the less\nbenevolent is the karma it creates.\n In Sanskrit a benefic planet is a shubha (a 'pious being'), while\na malefic is a papi (a 'sinner'). The malefics are 'sinners' because\nthey encourage the people whose minds they seize to scorn Nature\nand Her laws. Nature favors no man or woman: if you follow Her\nrules, you will prosper; if you flout them, you will suffer.\n Some jyotishis refer to the Sun as a natural malefic, others say it\nis merely 'cruel' (krura), and a few assert that it is cruel only when\nexalted, and malefic otherwise. Malefics are also cruel, but the Sun is\nless likely to cause a person to 'sin' than are the other malefics.\nThe Sun is fierce by nature but is not deliberately cruel; anyone who\nhas lived through a hot season in India knows precisely how cruel\nthe Sun can be. Astrologically, the Sun is cruel because he dries up\nthe rasa, the juice or nectar of life which makes life worth living.",

This same\nclassification can also be extended to apply to the intra-uterine\nperiod, thus providing useful insights into birth psychology.

Some defend this practice by saying that this method is\npart of the Parashari system, since it is included in Brihat Parashara\nHora, but this does not mean that it is integral to Parashari Jyo-\ntish; it may have been a later addition. To determine the significa-\ntors for relatives by the Jaimini method and then to use them in\na Parashari mode to analyze relations causes inherent contradic-\ntions. It is as illogical to use Jaimini significators with Parashari\naspects as it would be to use diesel fuel in a petrol engine.",

Since every amsha, or portion of\nthe zodiac, is smaller than a rashi (ranging in size from I y o to jo',\nand, in Nadi Jyotish, to 6' of arc), they manage the rashi by\ndelineating results for specific matters within the broad context of\neach rashi. They are particularly useful to differentiate between two\nsimilar horoscopes. For example, everyone born within the two and\na half years that Saturn transits Libra will have Saturn in their birth\ncharts in Libra but, because most will have a different pattern of\namshas according to their specific times of birth, the differences in\nthe amshas will suggest differences in life experience.\n Parashara lists sixteen amsha charts (we can also call them\nsubcharts). Nadi and Tajika Jyotish add the fifth, sixth, eighth and\nthe one-hundred-and-fiftieth amshas. We will confine our comments\nhere to the ninth subchart, or nauamsba, which is by all accounts the\nmost important of all the amshas. One reason for its pre-eminence is\n\n the numerological fact that there are nine grahas. Another reason is\n the spatial fact that since the navamsha is the ninth division, each\n joo rashi is divided into nine parts of jo 20' each, a distance which\n happens to be one-fourth of a nakshatra (see Chapter Eight).\n Therefore nakshatras always start at the beginning point of a\nnavamsha and end at the terminating point of a navamsha.",

For example, the first navamsha in Capricorn is\nCapricorn, followed by Aquarius, then Pisces, Aries, Taurus and so\non up to Virgo.\n Note that the first navamsha for the cardinal constellation (chara\nrashi) is always that constellation; the fifth navamsha for a fixed\nconstellation (sthira rush() is always that constellation; and the ninth\nnavamsha for a mutable constellation (dvisvabhava rashi) is always\nthat constellation.

Many Indians\n mistakenly translate dbarma as 'religion', and render Sanatana Dharma\n as 'the eternal religion', when dharma is so much more than mere\n dogma and ritual.\n Dharma, which comes from a Sanskrit root meaning 'to establish',\n is that path through life which establishes an individual as a stable,\n productive, satisfied human being. The Sanatana Dharma, like the\nTao, is the One Way, the Infinite Path which differs for every\n seeker but which, when followed wholeheartedly, takes each unerr-\n ingly to the goal. Dharma is an inborn faculty of existence, not an\n externally derived discipline: 'These activities called dharma are\nimposed as a kind of natural law on all existent beings in the\nuniverse; and a being's initiating of such activity is no moral act\ncontingent on his disposition, but an innate characteristic, that\nwhich makes a being what it is, assigning the part it is to play in\nconcert.

Tenth-house activities are public\n activities which are performed in the bright light of the Sun, as\nopposed to private human activity, which happens predominantly at\nhome, at night, when the Sun is invisible in the fourth house of\nhome. The Sun is not as happy in the fourth house as it is in the\n tenth. The death of the Sun as it sets in the seventh house makes\nthat house a maraka. This principle extends to all the planets: They\nare 'born', or come into visible existence, when they rise in the first\nhouse of a locality; they act most strongly in the tenth; they die in the\nseventh, and they are most private and home-bound in the fourth.\n The rising Sun, which is by definition always in the ascendant, is\nimpressive because of the dramatic contrast it provides between the\ndarkness of the night now past and the promise of light of the day\njust dawning.

For example, when the sixth lord sits in the eleventh house\n(the sixth from the sixth) the native may suffer from one disease\nafter another. Or, when the lord of the fourth house of education\nsits in the seventh house (the fourth from the fourth), the native\nmay well study one subject after another, or obtain one degree after\nanother. This will be particularly true for a Pisces lagna, in which\nthe fourth lord Mercury will be exalted in the seventh house, from\nwhich it will aspect the lagna.\n Since houses 6, 8 and 1 2 from the lagna are bad houses, and all",

    "output": "the rest are basically good, the sixth, eighth, or twelfth house from\nany house often causes trouble to that house. Because the twelfth\nhouse of a horoscope is the house of loss, the twelfth house to any\nhouse indicates the loss or the end of the things that bhava\n indicates. Because the third and eighth houses of a horoscope are\nhouses of longevity, the twelfth house counted from the eighth\nhouse ( = the horoscope's seventh house) and the twelfth from the\nthird house (= the horoscope's second house) become the houses\nof 'loss of longevity', or death. This is another reason why the\nsecond and seventh houses are marakas. Because the third house is\ntwelve houses away from the fourth house, it may represent the end\nof residency or home (which means a move). It might also represent\nthe end of the mother, or the partition of property.\n The sixth house from any house also holds ominous implications\nfor that house. When the fifth lord sits in the tenth house it\noccupies the sixth house away from the house it rules. Normally\nplanets that occupy the tenth house should give good results, since\nthe tenth is a good house; but the lord of a house in the sixth from\nits own house should give bad results. This contradiction can\nusually (but not always) be reconciled by dividing the matters\nindicated by the fifth house into two classes: living beings (like\nchildren) and everything else (like intelligence, or speculation). The\nposition from the lagna (the tenth house = a good house = good\nresults) will tend to predominate for all indications of the fifth\nhouse other than living beings, which means that those things will\ntend to prosper. For living beings, however, the position of the\nhouse lord vis-i-vis the house (tenth house = sixth from fifth =\nbad results) tends to predominate, suggesting difficulty begetting\nprogeny, or problems with those children.\n This applies to all other houses as well. When Jupiter, the lord of\nthe second house for a Scorpio ascendant, occupies the seventh\nhouse (the sixth from the second) there is bound to be initial\ntrouble with cash flow and other non-living second-house matters,\nbut this trouble will dissipate as time passes. Because the second\nhouse also represents one's family, however, the individual may\nhave difficulty with his family, or may leave home early and live far\naway from them. The fourth lord in, say, the eleventh house will\nlikewise create difficulties with education or with vehicles, which",

    "output": "will eventually be resolved but which may create a much more\nproblematical situation with the native's mother.\n Here is a general rule: When the lord of a house is in a good\nhouse as counted from the lagna and a bad house (sixth, eighth or\ntwelfth) as counted from the house it rules, there will be a tendency\nfor everything indicated by that house (except for living beings) to be\n initially obstructed and then to be rectified, while the living beings\nindicated by that house will tend to be more permanently disturbed.\n There are of course exceptions to this rule that the living beings\nindicated by a bhava are adversely affected when the lord of that\nhouse is in the sixth, eighth or twelfth house from it. For a Cancer\nascendant the fifth house is Scorpio, which is ruled by Mars. When\nMars occupies the tenth house, it will be in the sixth from the fifth,\nbut (a) it will tenant its own rashi, and (b) it will aspect the fifth\nbhava as its own bhava. Mars should therefore give good results for\nchildren (a fifth-house matter), unless it is severely afflicted. But\neven an exalted planet with no obvious afflictions which serves as\nthe fifth lord and resides in the tenth house (as Venus can do for a\nGemini ascendant) may be unable to produce a child or may give\nsome difficulty with children, because it sits in the sixth from the\nfifth but does not strengthen the fifth by aspect.\n When the lord of a horoscope's third house occupies the eighth\nhouse, its position is inauspicious both from the lagna and from the\nhouse (since the eighth is the sixth from the third). This position is\ntherefore doubly bad for younger brothers and sisters. A similar\nsituation occurs when the lord of the seventh house tenants either\nthe twelfth house (the sixth from the seventh) or the sixth house\n(the twelfth from the seventh). A desirable placement occurs when\nthe lord of a house occupies good positions both from the house\nand from the lagna, as it does when the lord of the ninth house\nresides in the fifth house, which is the ninth from the ninth (and so\nin this situation is also a case of Bhavat Bhavam).\n All these numerical values for the houses are derivative, calculated\nmeanings which can only be taken so far, lest they become\ncontradictory.",

Like most of Tantric Jyotish's unique\nmethods, Svarodaya, which has been preserved principally by oral\ntransmission from a guru to an initiated disciple, provides some\nfascinating insights into the profundity of Tantric thought; Svaro-\ndaya was disclosed by Lord Shiva, one of India's principal deities,\nto his divine spouse Parvati, intending that she keep it secret. The\ngreat yogi Matsyendra Nath, the first head of the Nath lineage of\nimmortal yogis, took the form of a fish and, listening carefully,\nstealthily absorbed that vidya into himself. He then taught it to his\ndisciple Gorakh Nath, who taught. it to his disciples. Thus, it was\ntransferred era by era, until today.\n Svarodaya's basic principles make use of the difference of effect\nbetween the functioning of the Lunar Nadi (the left nostril) and the\nSolar Nadi (the right nostril). Healthy humans do not normally\nbreathe out of both nostrils simultaneously. Instead, one nostril\nalone breathes at a time, usually for ninety minutes; then the other\nnostril takes over, again for about ninety minutes. Only occasionally,\nparticularly around sunrise and sunset, do both nostrils work\ntogether.\n One of the most fundamental and widespread tenets of the Indian\nworld view is that everything which exists outside the human body\nin the cosmos (the macrocosm) also exists, in altered form, within it\n(the microcosm). This principle, known as the Law of the Macro-\ncosm and Microcosm, is India's statement of the old Hermetic\ndoctrine: 'As above, so below'. Svarodaya implies that, among\nother things, those who know the movements of the Sun, the Moon\nand the other planets can use this knowledge to predict the nature\nof the movement of the breath in their bodies, or in other bodies.\nLikewise the movements of breath in the microcosm can be used to\ndetermine the positions of the planets in the macrocosm.",

    "output": "One way in which this can be done is to use the time unit nadi\n (literally, 'a channel, tube, or hollow stem') to correlate the move-\n ments of the breath, the pulse, and the prana (the life force). The\n nadi, which represents 24 minutes of time (half of one muhurta), is\nalso defined in the J'urya J'iddhanta to be equal to 3 6 0 respirations\n (also called prana), each respiration being defined as the time it takes\n clearly to enunciate ten long syllables.\n 24 minutes of time is 1/60 of a day, and during one day (of\napproximately 24 hours) the entire 360\" of the zodiac pass over the\nhorizon. This same nadi which measures time, breathing and cadence\ntherefore also measures space: one nadi = 1/60 x 360' = 6\" = 360\nminutes of arc. Since one nadi = 360 respirations, one respiration\n(or ten long syllables) covers a distance in the sky equal to one\nminute of arc. By standardizing the internal time-units of recitation\nand breathing in terms of the external time-unit day, the seers of\nold succeeded in transplanting external time into the internal cosmos\nof the jyotishi. Such a 'standardized' jyotishi functions as a sort of\nliving clock whose breathing patterns can be used for divination.\n Modern science creates new words to represent new units of\nmeasurement, and as this new terminology proliferates the awareness\nof how to relate these units together often recedes. Sanskritic\nscience, which concentrates on relationships, prefers to re-use the\nsame word to represent similar units in different contexts. That the\nrishis chose the word 'nadi' when they named their science Nadi\nJyotish also suggests that Svarodaya assisted them in that work.",

The number 28 is particularly important here\nbecause the average of the lengths of the synodic month of 29.j\ndays and the sidereal month of 27.3 days is approximately 28.4 days,\na number which is not too far from the jo days of the solar month.\nBecause each of the seven visible planets can own one day of a\nseven-day week, the system of rulerships thus formed can correlate\nthe grahas with the 28 nakshatras. The system of 28 Yogas in\nShripati's Ratnumala, which connects the nakshatras with the days\nof the week to determine auspicious moments for activity, is evi-\ndence of just this sort of astrological thinking.\n The question of how the grahas, the bright gods of the heavens,\ndivided these seven days among themselves is the subject of another\nteaching tale. After the twelve constellations of the zodiac had been\nassigned their lords, the time came to distribute the lordship of the\ndays of the week. The life-giving Sun, the most important body in\nthe heavens, naturally took the first unit, which became Sunday.\nThe Moon accordingly took possession of the next unit, which\nbecame Monday. The two regents then turned their attention to\napportioning the remaining weekdays to their 'followers'. After\npondering over the problem, the Sun and Moon agreed that while\nthe constellations are divisions of space, days are divisions of time.\nDay rulerships were then allocated according to the speed at which\nthe planets move. Based on their averaged rate of daily proper\nmotion, as seen from the Earth, the Moon is the fastest planet,\nfollowed in descending order by Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars,\nJupiter and Saturn.

An interesting comparison exists between this\nsystem and the other system that is commonly used for time\ndivision in Jyotish. Just as the day can be divided into twenty-\nfour hours of sixty minutes each, it is also divisible into sixty nadir\n(which are often called gbatikas) of twenty-four minutes each.\nThese two systems complement each other in the same sort of\nway that the jo tithis of 12' each complement the I 2 rashis of joo\neach.\n The first hora (hour) of each day is ruled by that day's planetary\nruler. Since the day in India is taken to start from sunrise, the first\nhour after sunrise on a Sunday is ruled by the Sun, the first hour\nafter sunrise on a Monday belongs to the Moon, Mars rules Tues-\nday's first hour after sunrise, and so on. After the ruler enjoys his\nhour, the other planets then rule in the sequence of their increasing\naveraged rate of daily proper motion. After each planet has ruled an\nhour, the process begins again from the day lord. Thus on Sunday\nthe order is: Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and\nMars; on Monday it is Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus\nand Mercury; and so on. Note also that the cycles flow uninterrupt-\nedly from one day to the next, creating thereby the rulerships\nshown in Table 7. I .\n An approximation of the time of sunrise can be obtained from the\nweather section of a big-city newspaper. While the hora is commonly\ntaken to be one hour long, it is precisely one hour long only at the\nequator, or on equinoctial days (when day and night are of equal\nlength).

The most useful astrological\nprinciple involving the days is this: Each dq's nature is akin to that of\nits ruler. Jupiter infuses Thursday, its day, with many of the qualities\nand rulerships assigned to it in Chapter Two. This makes Thursday\na generally benefic day (since Jupiter is a generally benefic graha), a\nday which is good for prayer, children, money, meeting gurus, and\nall the other things which Jupiter rules. Saturday, the day of Saturn,\nis similarly imbued with Saturn's qualities. This makes it generally\nmalefic in nature, like its ruler, a day that brings delays, obstacles\nand disappointments to almost everyone.\n Although these generic traits are subject to modification by every\nother astrological factor influencing a situation, since Jyotish eter-\nnally strives to reach a holistic reading of reality, this does not make\nthem any less true. Our Jyotish guru said one day, in all seriousness,\n'No wonder everyone in this country gets divorced. They all marry\non Saturday!' Most Indians try to avoid choosing Saturday for\nany sort of auspicious function, because of its association with\ndisappointment. Many religious Indians prefer to commence their\njourneys only on Thursday because its ruler, Jupiter, is a benefic\nwho resonates with their values and purposes. Journeys on Tuesdays\nare often ill-starred, because Tuesday is ruled by the troublesome\nMars.\n Here is one example of how days are used in Jyotish: a woman",

While many companies are of course able to\n hold peaceful Tuesday board meetings, this woman's experience of\nTuesdays was particularly painful because her Mars was debilitated\n in Cancer in her eighth house and was subject to a number of\n afflictions. Because her natal horoscope had a Sagittarius ascendant\nwith a well-placed Jupiter, it was recommended that she move the\nboard meetings to Thursdays. Since then she has reported a colossal\nand lasting improvement in the flow of the meetings and the\nattitude of the participants over two years of Thursday board\nmeetings.\n The above example of an astrological judgment uses the days of\nthe week for a selection (mzlbtrrta) in the context of a person's natal\nchart.

They can be contentious, disputatious,\n obstreperous, oppressive, quarrelsome and pugnacious. They lo1.e\n to steal the spotlight, and resist giving others their chance therein.\n They may experience many painful diseases.

The nakshatras, which seem to be uniquely Indian in origin,\nseem to have been an important part of 'Vedic' culture, for they\nhave been in continuous use in India since Vedic times. The\nnakshatras are much used in Jyotish even today, particularly in\norder to determine, via electional astrology, the appropriate ritual to\nperform or mantra to recite on a particular day. For example,\njyotishis who wish to achieve success at palmistry will often begin\nworship of the goddess PancbanguIi ('Five Fingers') when the Moon\noccupies the nakshatra Hasta (which means 'the hand'). One vital use\nfor the nakshatras in natal astrology is in timing the events that a horo-\nscope may promise; this is considered in detail in Chapter Eleven.\n The nakshatras are regarded in Indian mythology as the Moon's\nbrides, for each night the Moon appears to move from the mansion\nof one wife to the next. That there were either 27 or 28 nakshatras\nis likely a consequence of the fact that a sidereal month lasts 27.3217\ndays, which can either be rounded up to 28 or rounded down to 27.\nThe number 28 (7 days times 4 weeks) was once more meaningful\nto Jyotish than is 27, probably in the era before the number of\ngrahas became standardized at nine. 27 divides evenly into 360\" to\ncreate an arc of 13\" 20' per nakshatra, while 360\" divided by 28\nnakshatras yields cumbersome arcs of about I 2\" j I' 26\".\n Four rashis cover precisely the same amount of space (I 20\") as do\nnine nakshatras, a relationship which helps to integrate the zodiac\nwith the cycle of the nakshatras and may have helped fix the\nnumber of nakshatras at 27.

Anuradha, translated as 'following Radha',\nrefers to the fact that this nakshatra follows 'Radha', which is\nanother name for Vishakha.\n The bracketed names in the 'Astronomical Name' column are the\npopular names of some well-known stars.

If, for instance, the lord of the fifth house (children) is\nJupiter (a male graha) and is in a male nakshatra, one would expect\nthe birth of a boy - provided of course that the chart promises a birth.\n An interesting dilemma can arise when using grahas, rashis and\nnakshatras in this context. No problem arises if the graha, rashi and\nnakshatra all agree in gender; but if one is neutral, the next male, and\nthe last female, then a major difficulty exists, which can best be solved\nby deciding the strongest of the factors under consideration. T o do\nthis, use the standard methods for determining planetary strength to\nevaluate the strength of the graha, the ruler of the rashi, and the\nnakshatra lord involved. If the lord of the fifth house in a horoscope\nis the neutral graha Mercury who sits in the male rashi of Aries (ruled\nby Mars) and in the female nakshatra of Bharani (ruled by Venus), the\nstrongest among Mercury, Mars and Venus would then indicate the\nmost likely outcome. In this example, Mercury is neutral in strength,\nsince Mars is neutral to Mercury. If Mars were in its own rashi and\nVenus were exalted, then Venus would be strongest (all other factors\nbeing equal), and a girl would be indicated; if the relative strengths of\nMars and Venus were reversed, a boy would be more likely.\n\nThe Kapha nakshatras are KRITTIKA,ROHINI,ASHLESHA,MAGHA,\n SWATI,VISHAKHA,UTTARA ASHADHA,S H R A V A N A and REVATI.",

Mythologically, Krittika (the\nPleiades) is the collective foster-mother of Karttikeya, one of the\nsons of Shiva.\n Krittika people are sharp, cutting and penetrating by nature.\nThe symbolism of the razor also points to sharp or pointed imple-\nments and the work done with them, such as the skinning of\nanimals for leather and fur production. Sharp writing and sewing\nimplements and sharp tools like drills are all ruled by Kr' tika. The\nhandsome Karttikeya's role as the general of the cel stial army i\"\nexpresses Krittika's rulership over war, battles, armies and disputes,\nand Kartikkeya's renown for his monumentally heroic deeds sug-\ngests for Krittika fame and larger-than-life endeavors and projects.\nSince Karttikeya's personal bodily luster and armor was said to\nshine like the golden Sun, Krittika also rules gold, and has some\nassociation with wealth. Its mythology also indicates adoption,\nfoster care, and the assumption of responsibility for protecting\nothers.\n The full symbolism of the ruling deity, Agni, is exceedingly\nintricate. Physiologically it relates primarily to the body's digestive\nfire, which enables the digestion and assimilation of food. Therefore\nKrittika rules appetite, cooking, digestion and the like. Agni also\nindicates the mental 'fire' which enables the digestion and assimila-\ntion of information and knowledge. Just as the fire flares up and\ndies away, Krittika people tend to experience frequent ups and\ndowns in their private lives. When either the lagna or the Moon\noccupies Krittika, ambition, pride and self-motivated qualities often\nappear in the native's personality.\nPLysiology & Diseases: The hips and loins; the upper and back\nportions of the head.\nProfessions, People & Places: Inventors, discoverers and excavators.\nHeads of state or other big organizations.

Because Brahma rules,,&ation and origins,\nespecially of the material world, Rohini governs sowing and plant-\ning, sprouting and growing. Since Rohini's cart is pulled by oxen,\nthis nakshatra also rules both cattle and conveyances. Being very\ngrowth-oriented, it connotes rising, climbing, or being lifted to a\ngreat height, and also all sorts of promotion and development.\nRohini imperceptibly but surely eludes obstacles and disengages\nfrom anything that comes in its way, but its association with\nmateriality does create a potential for vulgarity.\n One ancient Indian myth makes Rohini, the red star Aldebaran in\nTaurus, the favorite of the Moon's 27 nakshatra-wives, because of\nher beauty, charm and culture, her expertise in art and music, and\nher skill in the conjugal arts. The word 'Rohini' is etymologically\nlinked with a Sanskrit term for red, a color which symbolizes\npassion and sensuality and is the color of its principal star.

In that\n half of the nakshatra which falls in the Earth rashi of Taurus, the\n search takes place on the physical plane, and on the mental plane in\n the half which falls in the Air rash of Gemini. Since deer roam\naround on predictable trails, this asterism is associated with journeys,\nmoves, roads and paths. Mrigashirsha also suggests hunting, which\n is one form of search. Because the Moon, its deity, is an enchanting,\nchangeable, inconstant, fickle body, Mrigashirsha indicates a clever,\npersuasive person who is sensual and fickle.

Lack of gratitude and a certain malice are traditionally\n associated with this nakshatra, which may create a tendency to\ntreachery and deception concerning business or finance. Ardra also\n rules diplomacy, people who are critical by nature, cruelty, lawless-\nness, perversity, self-centered attitudes, lying and cheating. When\nthe lagna or the Moon occupies Ardra, the native may have strong\nfeelings which may be overwhelming.\n Planets positioned in Ardra, and the matters indicated by the houses\nthey rule, may be a source of sorrow and disappointment. If Mars, one\nsignificator for siblings, happens to be lord of the third house of\nsiblings (as it is for Virgo and Aquarius lagnas) and happens to occupy\nArdra, the native may have no siblings or may have a difficult\nrelationship with them, or a brother or sister may die or be seriously\ndistressed. Ardra being feminine, when the lord of a horoscope's fifth\nhouse is associated with Ardra, the first child is expected to be female,\nthough another opinion is that any graha connected with children\nbecomes mostly barren when occupying this nakshatra.\n If Ardra figures prominently in your horoscope, you can take\nheart (though its significations seem undesirable) from the thought\nthat loss may lead to new growth and that your tears may be the\nmoisture which will make your world fecund yet again.

Aditi represents true\nfreedom and plenty, which is the product of an amiable, adaptive,\nunderstanding and reasonable character, one who is capable of\nbeing happy with little when necessary. Aditi is also associated with\nvirtues and, by extension, the striving to act nobly, which links\nPunarvasu to philosophy, religion, yoga, and similar means to\nenhanced self-understanding.

The Moon or Jupiter\nposited in the fourth quarter of this nakshatra (which falls in the\nfirst part of the constellation Cancer) gives strong spiritual yearn-\nings, and may also indicate archetypally feminine virtues and graces.\n Punarvasu's quiver symbolizes potential energy and resources,\nthe arrows being ready for use as appropriate.

This may result in a simultane-\nous preference for travel and a dislike for changing residence.

Purva\n Phalguni and Uttara Phalguni being in many ways similar, their\n general indications are to a great extent interchangeable and comple-\n mentary; even their deities are often worshipped together. Uttara\n Phalguni, through its association with Aryaman, has however an\n additional connotation of eagerness to help others and alleviate\n suffering through kindness and generosity. It also indicates the\n people one approaches for favors and boons, the patronage one is\n likely to receive in life, and one's intimates and very close friends.\n While benefics well placed in this nakshatra may enhance intimate\n relationships, malefics that are poorly placed there will disturb them.\n When Uttara Phalguni is somehow prominent in a birth chart, there\nmay be gain or scandal or both through amorous adventures.

The presiding\ndeity is Savitri or Surya, the Sun.\n The hand suggests skilled activities, and also indicates both a\ngrasping nature and an ability to grab and hold on to all sorts of\nthings, be they material, spiritual, mental, emotional or physical.\nHasta's image is of daily repetitive work and achievement (e.g. as an\nartisan) rather than leadership, though it does enhance industry,\nenterprise, invention and subtle thought. It gives the potential for a\nquestionable moral orientation and a pliable conscience. The closed\nfist symbolizes determination and a tendency to wish to control\nthrough any means, honorable or dishonorable. The hand also\nprovides Hasta an association with palmistry and, by extension,\nwith Jyotish.\n The Sun, who spreads light all around, is responsible for Hasta's\nilluminating intelligence, especially as it applies to counseling and\nadvising. One of Hasta's traditional associations not readily apparent\nfrom its symbolism or deity is that of jesting, merriment, laughter\nand ridicule. Lagna or Moon in Hasta often indicates a clever, witty\nand entertaining person who is somewhat flighty and not very\ndependable. One unique attribute of this nakshatra is that when\nHasta is associated with the lord of the fifth house it may deny\nchildren, or create problems with them.\nPhysiology & Diseases: The hands and the fingers.\nProfesssins, People Q Places: Advisers, ministers, authors, ,counselors,\neducators and priests.

The delicate Swati always strives for greater\ngrowth and independence in the same way that a plant's young\nshoot self-individuates on its way to maturity in spite of being\nvulnerable and fragile. Lagna or Moon here often indicates a person\nwho is philosophical, thoughtful, spiritual or religious, one who\ntends to need time to digest his or her understanding. Swati has a\nspecial association with Saraswati, the goddess of learning who is\ninvoked particularly for progress in literature and music. It is\nauspicious to begin worshipping Saraswati when the Moon occupies\nSwati.\n Swati also symbolizes purification, restlessness and a tendency to\nsway back and forth or experience some instability. These tendencies\nmay be keyed to the house that Swati occupies or to the planets which\noccupy Swati. That Swati's deity is Vayu reinforces its proclivity to\nrestlessness and roaming, and alludes to the possibility that the body's\nwind (its Vata, Ayurvedically-speaking) may be disturbed.

Vishakha is the conqueror, fixated on\n defeating rivals. Goals form one of the primary meanings of this\n nakshatra but, when the only objective in life becomes attainment\n of a goal, the individual may begin to believe that the desired end\n justifies the use of questionable means. Vishakha people may become\n dictators (either benevolent or malevolent, depending on their\n values). Such people are often impelled to develop and perfect\n logical proofs for their dogmas, so that they delve, but obsessively,\ninto their chosen subjects. They tend to present their findings so\naggressively that they alienate their audiences.\n Lagna or Moon in Vishakha often gives profound courage, and a\ncapacity to exert Herculean efforts in the direction of the goal but,\nif obstructions impede achievement of those goals, courage can\nmutate into frustrated and impatient anger. Vishakha's firm resolve\ncan cause the mind to force the body to perform to its ambitious\nexpectations. Inordinate ambition can lead Vishakha to become\nspread too thinly in trying to fulfill too many aspirations, which can\nresult in an egocentric life which has little time for anything but the\npursuit of self-interests.

Jyeshtha ( I 6\" 40' Scorpio t o joO oo' Scorpio)\n Varahamihira: Those with the Moon in Jyeshtha have very few\n friends but are cheerful, virtuous and irascible.\n General Indications: Jyeshtha's symbol is a round protective talisman,\n and its presiding deity is Indra, the king of the gods.\n The talisman is a physical expression of an understanding of\n occult or hidden forces. It can indicate either providing or receiving\n protection from some danger or adversity, as well as a capacity for\n subtle, inventive and imaginative design. Many hymns of the Veda\nhonor Indra for his daring deeds, power, fame, glory and praise-\n worthiness, all qualities associated with this nakshatra. When\nJyeshtha connotes gain, it may be through supernatural, occult or\nextraordinary means but, when afflicted, Jyeshtha betokens hard\ntimes and poverty. Saturn in Jyeshtha in, for example, the second\nhouse of money may reflect a decided lack of money, all other\nfactors being equal. Lagna or Moon here often indicates two-faced,\nhypocritical and secretive behavior.\n Jyeshtha means 'the eldest', particularly in social contexts, in\nwhich it represents 'the most important', 'the founder' or 'the\npreferred'. Seniority or preeminence based on preference or merit\nis equated here with protection because the eldest in a Hindu family\nis often perceived as the family's protector. The Jyeshtha person\nmay be the patriarch or matriarch of a family, the oldest brother,\nsister or child, or possibly a favored paramour. When, for example,\nthe lord of the seventh house of marriage occupies Jyeshtha, it\ninclines to marriage with an older person, or with a person who is\nsenior in his or her family, all other factors being equal.

They have firm and\nfixed opinions, and live in luxury.\nGeneral Indications: Mula's symbol consists of some roots bunched\ntogether and tied. Its deity is Nirriti ('calamity'), the goddess of\ndissolution who personifies evil and corruption and is sometimes\nknown as Alakshmi, the opposite of Lakshmi, the goddess of\nprosperity. Nirriti either directly induces material privation or causes\nprosperity to deteriorate after it is attained.\n Because roots penetrate deep into unseen realms, Mula is associ-\nated with getting to the bottom of things, literally or figuratively,\nby scientific, philosophical and other forms of deep inquiry. Though\nan individual often goes deeply into a matter ruled by a planet\nposited in Mula, that deep inquiry may not yield affluence, particu-\nlarly if the planet is otherwise afflicted, because Nirriti and Mula are\nopposed to abundance. For example, when the lord of the tenth\nhouse of profession occupies Mula, the individual may not prosper\nfrom his profession in a worldly sense, though he may delve deeply\ninto it. The late Martin Luther King, whose horoscope had this\ncombination, was a man whose level of worldly prosperity was not\ncommensurate with his depth of professional achievement. Since\nNirriti connotes opposites, reverses and losses, Mula is associated\nwith contrariness and with borrowing and lending to one's detri-\nment. As such, it is against the rules of electional astrology to lend\nor borrow during Mula, for the debt may go bad or prove to be\nvery vexatious.\n Lagna or Moon in Mula often indicates a skilled and clever\nindividual with good oratorical abilities who can enthrall an audi-\nence. Mula also stands for the unseen origins of visible conditions,\nlike the germs which are the roots of some diseases. Roots are also\nfoundations, beginnings and sources. Roots being much used for\nmedicinal purposes, Mula is associated with medicines. The fact that\nMula's roots are tied adds a certain sense of restraint, bondage\nor limited mobility, all meanings that accompany this nakshatra.",

Ptrrva Asbadha ( I 3\" 20' Sagittarius to 26' 40' Sagittarius)\n Varabamibira: The Moon in Purva Ashadha gives an agreeable\nspouse, a proud nature, and strong attachment to friends.\nGeneral Indications: Purva Ashadha's symbol is a fan or a winnowing\nbasket (which is used to separate grain from its husk). Its presiding\ndeity is Apah, or water deified as a god.\n Since another name for this nakshatra is Aparajita, 'the Unde-\nfeated', it connotes victory in struggles and confrontations. Purva\nAshadha enables one to be patient, to wait for obstacles or unpleas-\nant circumstances to subside in the way that a fan enables one\npatiently to tolerate uncomfortable heat. Fanning is actually an act\nof aggression on heat, just as winnowing grain is an act of aggression\non the grain. These may be the reasons why Purva Ashadha is also\nassociated with declarations of war and other aggressions. The fan\nand the winnowing basket being implements of culture that improve\nlife and comfort, Purva Ashadha tends to produce strong desires to\nimprove one's circumstances. If the planets activating this nakshatra\nare poorly placed, this often occurs in a self-indulgent way.\n Purva Ashadha strongly suggests invincibility and, when the\nlagna or the Moon appears in this nakshatra, it often indicates a\ngood debater, whose formal education may have been interrupted.\nApah or water is pervasive and universal, two qualities readily\nassociated with Purva Ashadha, which also promotes journeys by\nrivers and seas, sexual excesses, and watery diseases like water\nretention or abnormal kidney or bladder function.\n\nPhysiology e9 Diseases: The thighs; the back portion of the trunk.\nProfessions, People e9 Places: All professions, people and placei\nassociated with water in its various forms: shipping, sailing, navy,\nmarine life, water utilities, etc. People who process raw materials,\nlike manufacturers or refiners.",

Their names, in loose translation, are Goodness, Truth, Will-\npower, Skillfulness, Time, Desire, Firmness, Ancestors, Brightness\nand Peak (or Acme), all attributes which are associated with Uttara\nAshadha.\n The qualities of Purva Ashadha also apply to this nakshatra, as\none is the former (purva) part and the other the latter (uttara) part of\nthe same nakshatra. One difference between them is that Uttara\nAshadha is more introspective and possesses greater permanence\nand durability than does Purva Ashadha. It is also less aggressive\nthan its mate.

When poorly\nplaced, the native may start new projects helter-skelter, and then fail\nto complete them. An elephant's tusk is sharp, and so can penetrate.",

The circumferential fence\nsimultaneously protects the inner being from any outer danger and\nprevents it from joining the greater whole by segregating it, holding\nit captive. A shoreline confines a body of water in the same way\nthat the horizon, the limit of our vision, encloses the sky. Shatabhi-\nsha rules reservoirs, tanks, lakes, armor and shields, outer garments\nand cloaks. Shatabhisha is commonly assumed to cloak or veil\nthings, to keep them secret or hidden from view. This asterism also\nrules traps and paralysis, both literal and symbolic.

'If Saturn is in Libra the person\n will be famous, will be the head of his clan, a leader of a town,\ncommander of a force or the headman of a village, and will be\n wealthy.' These two observations, made by Varahamihira in Chapter\n I 8 of his Brihad Jataka, are uncomplicated examples of the type of\n interpretive statements called grahayogas ('planetary combinations').\n Simple graha yogas (which differ from the soli-lunar yogas of the\nPanchanga given above) involve only one or two astrological factors,\nsuch as the effects of each planet occupying each of the constellations\nand each of the houses, or the effects of the various planets when\nassociated with or aspected by other planets. The classical works on\nJyotish, in which graha yogas abound, unfortunately synthesize\nneither the various possible combinations that can result from a\nplanet's position by house, by constellation and by the aspects it\nreceives, nor the complex web of relationships that the astrological\nfactors spin when concepts more advanced than graha, rashi, bhava\nand aspect are factored into the interpretation.\n As a result, though the textually described effects of particular\nplanetary positions in a horoscope are sometimes dramatically cor-\nrect, at other times they land far from the mark. This is only to be\nexpected, since every person born on Earth during the two and a\nhalf years that Saturn sits in Aries is not a friendless, deceitful fool,\nnor is everyone born during Saturn's thirty-month sojourn in Libra\na famous, wealthy ruler. Clearly, further principles of differentiation\nare necessary for simple graha yogas if they are to have any utility.\n One solution to this problem 'is to create more complex graha\n\n I N T E R P R E T A T I O N O F T H E H O R O S C O P E 249",

But should the above two\n planets be strong and associated with or aspected by benefic planets,\nand if benefic planets occupy the fourth house, the planetary combi-\nnation will be conducive to the happiness of the mother.'\n Literally thousands of such statements pack the authoritative\ntexts on Jyotish in Sanskrit. Their number and complexity require a\nphenomenal memory, and colossal awareness, for their effective\nimplementation. Because any given horoscope commonly has but a\nfew of these elaborate combinations, it is neither practical nor\nproductive mechanically to catalogue and literally interpret them;\nwhen contradictory combinations which are not reconciled by the\ntexts also exist in the same horoscope, the jyotishi may be in a\ndilemma over which interpretation to apply. No amount of bookish\nstudy can teach a student how to reconcile all these multifarious\ninfluences, any more than any other art can be learnt from a book.\nBooks can provide only information; the reader must learn how to\njudge the many factors which do not admit of easy quantification,\nsuch as the fact that Saturn is such an important graha that, even\nwhen debilitated, it does not become completely without energy.\n While it is certainly desirable, despite these difficulties, to become\nfamiliar with the multitude of graha yogas stored in the various\ntexts, it is perhaps even more profitable to understand the principles\nof interpretation which underlie them. With good comprehension,\nand after mature reflection and experience, a good jyotishi can\ncreate a multitude of combinations and predict their potential\neffects. When, for example, you understand that malefic grahas\nobstruct the indications of the houses they contact, and that a\nconfluence of similar factors will guarantee such obstruction, you\ncan then create the statement that three or more malefics aspecting\nthe ascendant will create health problems (since the first house\nrepresents a person's physical well-being), or that three or more",

The confluence of\npredominantly good or bad indications gives the jyotishi an idea of\nwhat to predict. If equal testimonies for good and bad indications\n exist, jyotishis pray for guidance before using their experience and\nintuition to render a judicious judgement. Results are often more\npredictable in a very narrow domain than in a broader field which\ninvolves more variables.\n While looking for confluence, remember that life is usually not\nan all-or-nothing matter, and Jyotish, which tries to be a reliable\nmodel of life, tries to reflect this. Good and bad indications in a\nhoroscope usually do not cancel each other; if a house shows very\ngood results, the lord of the house shows very bad results and the\nsignificator shows neutral results, then both good and bad results\nwill happen. If such conditions apply in a horoscope to the fifth\nhouse, which predominantly indicates children, the person may\nhave beautiful children in whom they delight, but may also suffer\nthe heartbreak of losing a child. If, on the other hand, both the fifth\nbhava and its lord indicate good results and the karaka indicates bad\nones, then only the occasional fly will disturb the otherwise pleasing\nointment of one's children.\n Remember that these principles are abstractions which gain form\nand substance only from your own personal experience. It is one\nthing to say to a person whose horoscope you are interpreting, 'There\nwill be both happiness and unhappiness pertaining to children,' and it\nis quite another to say, 'One of your children may cause you great\nconcern on account of a marked tendency to ill-health, but your other\ntwo kids will most likely be healthy, highly educated, and respected in\ntheir professions.' It is something else entirely to grasp the confluence\nof factors well enough to be able confidently to apply upaya\n(remedies), Jyotish's 'phantom limb', and to recommend strategies to\nmodify or preven* the possibility of ill-health to the child in question.\n While searching for confluence, be sure to limit yourself to the\nprinciples of Jyotish.

In the chart under consideration, the second\nhouse is occupied by Venus and Mercury, who are, for this and for\nevery other chart that has a Virgo ascendant, the lords of houses 2\n I@and 9 and of houses I and respectively. The second house is\ntherefore strong even from this point of view, as is the eighth\nhouse, which is aspected by Venus, Mercury and Jupiter, all of\nwhom are lords of benefic houses, none of whom are lords of\nmalefic houses.\n '. . . provided such houses are without the aspect or association of\nmalefics . . .'\n'Association of a planet' means either 'occupation of a house by a\nplanet' or 'sharing a constellation with another planet'. Up to this\npoint in our examination of this horoscope we have seen that\nhouses 2, 4, 6 and 8 are likely to produce good results. We now\nsee that, while neither the second nor the eighth bhavas has the\naspect or association of any malefic, the fourth house has the\nassociation of Saturn and the full aspect of Mars, and the sixth\nhouse has the association of Ketu. (It also has the full aspect of\nRahu but, because Rahu and Ketu are always in constellations\nopposite to one other, we consider the occupation of a house by\nonly the one or the aspect of that house by the other.) Man-\ntreshwara's principle therefore so far applies in toto only to the second\nand eighth bhavas, since among the four houses which are likely to\nproduce good results they alone lack the aspect or association of\nmalefics.\n'. . . This will be so even if malefics own the houses concerned.'",

When a malefic aspects or occupies its own\nbhava, is its lordship of the house more important, or does its status\nas a natural malefic win out? Here he states clearly that lordship is\nmore important, and that a malefic which aspects or occupies its\nown bhava is bound to give good results for that bhava. Since in\nthis horoscope Saturn, a natural malefic, aspects the sixth house,\nwhere lies Aquarius, one of the two constellations that Saturn rules,\nthe sixth house is bound to be benefited thereby.\n '. . . This good effect of the houses will be certain if the planets involved\nare strong, that is, not in their debilitation constellation, not combust and\nnot in the constellation of their enemy.'\nThis is the last criterion to be applied to determine whether or not a\nbhava will produce exclusively good effects. Even if all the above\nconditions are fulfilled, good results become certain only if the\nplanets involved are strong, as specified here. Since in Chart z none\nof the planets that favorably influence the second house (Venus and\nMercury) or the eighth house (Venus, Mercury and Jupiter) is\ndebilitated, combust or in the constellation of an enemy, we are\ncompelled to conclude that in this horoscope Mantreshwara's prin-\nciple applies in toto to the second and eighth bhavas, so we must\npredict these houses to give desirable results in abundance.\n The native is in fact a millionaire who sings and speaks well, has\na handsome face and good eyes, deals in precious gems, is fascinated\nby and supports classical lore, and enjoys the comforts of a close-\nknit extended family (all these being primary second-house mean-\nings). Similarly, he will gain significantly through inheritance upon\nthe death of his parents; has been (and will be) protected from\naccidents and chronic illness; has not been damaged by (and may yet\ngain through) litigation; and is likely to undergo a comfortable and\npainless death (all of which are eighth-house matters).\n Once you begin to apply this principle to the horoscopes in your\ncollection, you will find that, though it is rare to find this combina-\ntion of beneficial influences to be present in toto, often much of it\nwill apply to a few of a horoscope's houses.

For example, to estimate the\nexperience of birth, infancy and youth, the first house, the lord of\nthe first house, and the bhava karaka of the first house (which in\nthis context will always be the Sun) must be analyzed.\n Mantreshwara's verses provide us with the criteria we need to\nestablish whether or not a bhava, its lord or its significator is\ndevoid of strength.

One portion of Mantreshwara's verse that is quoted above\nreads: 'All bhavas will give rise to exclusively good results if\noccupied or aspected by . . . their own lords.' When the lord ~f a\nhouse supports (by occupation or aspect) his own house, the soul in\neffect invigorates, protects and directs the body, and whenever\nbody and soul work together harmoniously success is certain, for\nindividual grahas, or. humans. A bhava is a state of being or\nconsciousness, and every graha takes on the state of being of the\nbhava it occupies. When therefore the soul of a house is tormented\n(by malefics, debilitation and the like), the bhava itself is bound to be\ntormented (because the body is secondary to, and dependent upon,\nthe soul), and any graha therein will share in the torment.\n It is particularly useful when trying to understand this thorny\nmatter to think of the grahas in anthropomorphic forms. Indian\nphilosophy recognizes two fundamental types of humans: those\nwho are straightforward (rjtc) and those whose are crooked (kutila).\nBenefics resemble the straightforward, those people who are funda-\nmentally good at heart, who try to follow the laws of the land and\nto live unselfishly. Malefics resemble the crooked, self-centered\npeople of society. Just as someone who is a crook by nature will\nalways do things the illegal way if he has the choice, a malefic\nalways tends to cause some difficulties, no matter what other sorts\nof benefits he may promise.\n Being straightforward, benefics are relatively predictable: a debili-\ntated benefic is weak, and an exalted benefic powerful. Exalted\nbenefics are strong, and have strength of character. Though debili-\ntated benefics try to be strong, they have weak personalities; when\nput under stress, their morality tends to crumble and they may\nbegin to behave like malefics. Stress arises from bad placement: the\naspect of or conjunction with malefics, occupation of the trik\nhouses, bad avasthas, and so on.\n Being crooked, malefics are less predictable. An exalted malefic is\na sort of elegant rogue, an iron fist in a velvet glove.

When the lord of the eighth house is\ndebilitated, for example, it will both reduce the native's longevity\nand increase the likelihood of accidents, so that when the native is\nin dire need of just a little bit of survival luck, that luck may be\ndenied. Should that debilitated malefic be somehow strengthened -\nby being retrograde, having directional strength, being involved in\na good yoga (like Parivartana Yoga; see Chapter Ten), being\nvargottama, having a good avastha, and so on - its good indications\n(by house rulership) will be enhanced, but its bad indications may\nnot be reduced.\n A debilitated graha may also obtain some energy from its disposi-\ntor if that dispositor is strong, and this may curtail its reign of\nterror. But when a debilitated graha's dispositor is itself debilitated,\none must predict the worst sorts of results, because that graha will\nbe tortured body and soul. Exalted grahas are much more likely to\ngive good results when their dispositors are exalted or otherwise\nstrong than when those dispositors are weak; when an exalted\ngraha's dispositor is debilitated, none of the good promised by that\nexaltation is likely to pan out, since there is nothing to back it up.\nAn exalted Jupiter (in Cancer) in a horoscope where its dispositor\nthe Moon is debilitated in Scorpio would be considerably weakened;\nthe same would happen to a Saturn in Libra if Venus tenanted\nVirgo.",

All are central to interpretation, and\nall are frequently misunderstood.\nCombustion - Combust planets move so close to the Sun that they\nbecome invisible to us. Being thus eclipsed, and because when\ncombust they are farthest from the earth (using the analogy, which\nis not necessarily causative, of an object becoming less able to\ninfluence another object the further it recedes from that other\nobject), the jyotishis of India concluded that the influence of com-\nbust planets becomes exceedingly weak, particularly regarding the\nhouses they own. Mercury, which cannot be further than one rashi\nfrom the Sun, is frequently combust, and perceptible problems\noften afflict the houses a combust Mercury rules in a birth chart.\n One useful rule for interpreting combustion is that while the\nexternalixed meanings (including the various bod3,parts) of a house are often\ndamaged when the ruler of that house is combust, the inner meanings\n(including particular4 the pychic or mental functions) are usual4 not\nspoiled. On the contrary, when the Sun, who represents the soul,\ncomes into contact with a planet, the inner or astral qualities of that\ngraha will become illumined and enlivened. Sun + Mercury often\ncauses the native to become intellectually brilliant (see Budhaditya\nYoga in the next chapter), and Sun + Venus tends to enliven the\nquality of beauty. How these results materialize will of course\ndepend on the various other influences that affect such combina-\ntions, for every person with Sun conjunct Mercury does not enjoy a\nlively intellect.\n The external qualities of the planets differ from person to person\naccording to their natural significations and the houses they control.\nJupiter, for example, rules the seventh and tenth houses in a Gemini\nascendant. Marriage being one external indication of the seventh\nhouse and career being an external indication of the tenth house,",

Because Jupiter is also the natural significator\n of children, which form another external object of an individual's\n experience, the native's children may also be affected by the combus-\n tion. Jupiter's inner qualities (like generosity, wisdom, love of\n knowledge, and intuition) may however become more apparent in\nsuch a person, enlivened by the proximity of the Sun.\n Natural benefics when combust lose ability to influence benefi-\n cently, proportionate to the closeness of the combustion. Natural\nmalefics when combust gain ability to influence maleficently, propor-\ntionate to the closeness of the combustion. While the implications\nof combustion may seem harsh, remember that many of Jyotish's\nprecepts display quite different effects in different contexts, so much\nso that sometimes the detrimental effect of combustion on certain\nhouse meanings may be desirable. A person whose sixth lord is\ncombust may under certain circumstances have very weak enemies.\nOr, when the indicators for brothers and sisters are combust in the\nhoroscope of someone who is disputing with his siblings over a will,\nthe combustion will both suggest the problems with the siblings and\nweaken the ability of those siblings to pursue their lawsuit.\n The closer a planet is to the Sun, the more severely combust it is,\nand the more severe its results will be. Also, keep in mind that a\nplanet is weaker when approaching its exact conjunction with the\nSun than it is when leaving that conjunction. A combust planet\nwhich also occupies its own rashi or is vargottama or exalted is\ncertainly better off than is a combust planet which is debilitated or\nin an enemy's rashi. One very important exception to the implication\nof combustion occurs when the Sun signifies great prosperity in a\nchart. What would be combustion in another horoscope would then\nbecome a planetary combination indicating affluence in one area of\nlife or another. Table 9.1 gives the range of degrees within which a\nplanet is combust.\nRetrogression - Remember that Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and\nSaturn sometimes appear to move backwards against the back-\nground of the fixed stars. This seeming backward movement is\nretrogression. While combust planets are farthest from Earth, retro-",

Such\n a planet can still give some desirable results if it owns good houses,\n though these good results will be less than if it were retrograde and\n exalted. A debilitated and retrograde planet which owns bad houses\n is likely to give adverse results. Phaladipika states that a debilitated\n but retrograde planet is equivalent to an exalted planet, a statement\nwhich is often misunderstood to be literal truth. Our Jyotish guru\n taught us that Mantreshwara may have meant this to illustrate that\n retrograde planets, while strong (like exalted planets), still need to\nbe evaluated in the overall context of the entire horoscope. This\n seems to be borne out by experience.\n Mantreshwara also says that exalted planets when retrograde act\n like debilitated planets, which is likely to be a cautionary statement\n for situations like this one: a retrograde malefic who owns detrimen-\n tal houses may create detrimental results even when exalted because\nof the cumulative results due to the combination of exaltation and\n retrogression. That Mantreshwara's statement is not true of all\nretrograde exalted planets becomes clear when we examine the\nhoroscope of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (see Chapter Twelve).\nLike other texts written to be taught by a guru who would elucidate\nmatters for the student, Phaladipika often does not bother to make\nclear, unambiguous statements. Because this sort of interpretation\ncan be had only from a guru, try as the uninitiated may to guess the\nmeaning of such passages they will never be able to do so, for they\nlack that interpretive guide which the guru holds.\nAvasthas - The avasthas introduced in Chapter Four are secondary\nsources of meaning which temper interpretations rather than reverse\nthem. Take Parashara's statement that planets in Mrita Avastha (the\nlast 6\" of an odd-numbered rashi or the first 6\" of an even-numbered\nrashi) impair the benefic results of its benefic combinations. A\nplanet in Mrita Avastha which is otherwise very strong (as by being\nexalted or in its own rashi) is severely weakened, no doubt, but is\nstill better placed than a debilitated planet in Mrita Avastha.",

But an exalted Venus who occupies the\nfifth house of a Scorpio lagna in the early degrees of Pisces (and so\nin Mrita Avastha) may indicate, rather than the literal death of a\nchild, that the native may treat his children 'as if dead' - disown\nthem, keep them at a distance, live at a great distance from them, or\nthe like. A Mercury exalted in Virgo in the fifth house of a Taurus\nlagna but in Bala Avastha may create a formidable intelligence\nwhich is, however, rather exuberant and untempered by experience,\nsince children and infants are not very experienced.\n Keep in mind when evaluating avasthas that sometimes a planet\nat the very beginning or end of a constellation may be in its\nvargottama navamsha, which will greatly modify its condition of being\neither in Mrita Avastha or in Bala Avastha (the first 6\" of an odd-\nnumbered rashi or the last 6\" of an even-numbered rashi). Although\na Saturn at the tail end of Virgo (between 26\" 40' and 30°) is in Bala\nAvastha, a position of weakness, it occupies Virgo in the navamsha\nas well, a position of strength which cancels and would sometimes\noverride the avastha position.\n To introduce yet another complexity, the star Spica, the yogatara\n(principal star) of Chitra nakshatra, is located at approximately\nz9\" 19' of Virgo (according to Lahiri). Spica is regarded, in both the\nEast and the West, as one of the most auspicious stars in the zodiac.\nSince Jyotish regards as good the conjunction of a planet with a\nfixed star (particularly if within an orb of one degree), the conjunc-\ntion of Saturn with this most auspicious star also overrides its being\nin Bala Avastha.

The balance of this book will build on these\nfundamentals by adding additional methods that can help smooth\nthe way to more difficult judgements.\n With the help of these principles you can confidently conclude\nthat when all the three factors - house, house lord and significator -\nunder consideration for a particular matter are strong in a horoscope,\nthey will enhance that matter. Similarly, when all three factors are\nweak, the corresponding matter will be weakened, which will create\nsome problem or difficulty.

Here\nJupiter is taken in its representative capacity as the significator of\neducation, and its position in the first house, a beneficial house,\nmeans that education will be benefited.\n Phaladipika adds for Jupiter in the first house 'blessed with\nchildren', a different statement based on the same reasoning: Jupiter\nas the significator of children in a good house. saravali and J'halad-\nipika make an additional subtle point with these last two interpreta-\ntions, which are based on Principle 7. When Jupiter sits in the first\nhouse, he aspects the ninth and the fifth houses, which are respec-\ntively the houses of higher education and children, in the capacity\nof a natural benefic. This is a good influence, again according to\nboth Principles I and 5 , and, since three principles of interpretation\nlead to the same result, this is a case of good confluence.\n To summarize the effects of grahas in bhavas:\n take the graha as a benefic or malefic, and combine its benefic or\n malefic impact with the meanings of the house it occupies; and\n take the graha as agraha karata, and combine its significations\n with the auspicious and/or inauspicious nature of the house it\n occupies.\nIn this way you can compose many more statements concerning the\neffects of planets in houses.

Factors\nsuch as whether a planet is exalted, debilitated, or in its own sign,\nand which planets aspect or conjoin it, are bound to change its\neffects.\n As an exercise in astrological thought, take some time to write\nout the interpretations you consider possible for the Nine Grahas as\na result of their position in each of the twelve houses, according to",

In fact, when you compare your results with\nsome textbook on Jyotish you may discover that you have learned\nmuch already. If you become diligent in this exercise, you will be\n well on your way to developing an ability to think astrologically.\nAlways beat in mind though that astrological interpretation is a\n sophisticated and subtle process which requires the synthesis of\nmany often-perplexing factors, and do not fall in love with your\n theoretical creations unless and until you find that your practical\nexperience overwhelmingly confirms them.\n As you strive to interpret a horoscope, conflicts will sometimes\n arise, conundrums which will usually hinge on some disparity\nbetween the natural benefics who favorably influence one sector of\nthe horoscope and the temporary malefics (rulers of bad houses\nand/or rulers of good houses that are badly placed) who influence\nthe same matter. In such cases the natural indications typical4 prevail on\n the st/bjective level and the temporav indications typical4 prevail on the\nobjective Level (in the person's environment).\n For instance, for a Pisces lagna Venus rules the third and the\neighth houses (two bad houses).

While Venus as a natural benefic\nin the lagna should protect the body (Principle I), Principle 16\nwarns us that someone whose eighth lord of accidents is extremely\nstrongly placed in the first house of the body may experience\nserious accidents. This enigma is resolved by noting that, while\naccidents are likely to occur (the objective level), the native is not\nlikely to be disheartened by them (the subjective level).\n To practice further the principles advanced thus far, start a\ncollection of horoscopes which are notable in some respect, e.g.\nhoroscopes from people who are talented musicians, or who are",

Similarly, Jupiter (who rules\noratory) in the second house in the first half of Sagittarius (a\nconstellation of voice) will indicate through confluence a far better\nspeaker than would Saturn (a mute planet) in the second house in\nPisces (a mute constellation).\n Only a combination of experience and intuition can establish\nwhether a Mercury-Mars combination will make the owner of the\nhoroscope a poor speaker, a great debater, a liar and cheat, a karate\nexpert, or all of them wrapped into one. The key to deciding which\nline of interpretation to follow in any particular instance lies in\nevaluating all factors of the combination simultaneously: the house\nand constellation in which the combination lies, the natures and\nrulerships of the grahas that compose it, the effect of other grahas\non the combination, and the native's environment and cultural\ncontext.\n While this style of interpretation is relatively straightforward in\ntheory, it becomes very involved in practice. Mistakes occur because\nit is not always humanly possible to consider every pertinent\ninfluence in the chart. The seers who gave us Jyotish tried to\nsimplify things for us by emphasizing graha yogas. While thus far\nwe have used the term 'graha yoga' to refer generically to the\ncombination of two or more grahas in a house, from now on we\nwill use it to refer to outstanding planetary combinations which\nindicate specific results. A few of the many classes of such yogas are\nRaja Yogas (which indicate leadership, power and fame); Dbana\nYogas (which suggest wealth) and Daridra Yogas (which promise\npoverty); Pravraa Yogas (which lead to renunciation of the world);\nand Balarisbta Yogas (which indicate death in childhood).\n Many of these yogas are well known to most jyotishis, who often\nlook for them on first glancing at a horoscope. Some jyotishis even\nfocus exclusively on these yogas, and on the indications given for\nthem in the traditional texts, for the more auspicious yogas there are\nin a horoscope, the more likely it will be for the person to become\nsomeone of note who will rise through life to be ~owerfuland",

The\n most important reason for this failure is that the dasbas (planetary\n periods; see Chapter Eleven) of the grahas involved do not occur at\n the appropriate periods of life. Another reason is that the grahas\ninvolved in the yogas may be weak (because of combustion, place-\nment in unfriendly rashis or inauspicious avasthas, or weakness in\n subcharts). Yet another reason is that under certain circumstances,\nwhich are described at the end of this chapter, a horoscope's\nbenevolent yogas can be canceled or broken (in Sanskrit bbanga).\n Except when noted, graha yogas are calculated from the ascend-\nant. Jyotishis often seek confirmation of a combination shown from\nthe ascendant by reading the horoscope from the constellation\noccupied by the Moon, using the latter as if it were the ascendant,\nsince after the ascendant the Moon is the fastest-moving factor in a\nhoroscope. This sort of 'tying down' of the chart is the Cbandra\nLagna (Moon Lagna), which is frequently used when the birthtime\nis very imprecise. When known, however, the ascendant is always\npre-eminent. Many graha yogas can be counted either from the\nMoon (Cbandra Yogas) or from the ascendant (Lagna Yogas) and, on\noccasion, also from the Sun lagna (Swya Lagna).\n Every student of Jyotish should practice locating the several\ngraha yogas below in many horoscopes in order to be able to\nrecognize them readily, and to get a headstart on understanding\nJyotish's many other yogas. As you scrutinize the horoscopes in\nyour possession, find out to what degree the yogas therein correlate\nwith the life experiences of the owners of the charts. Where the\ncorrelation is weak, try to find out what has weakened the planets\nwhich comprise the yoga.",

The description of Ruchaka Yoga is clearly a glorified\nlisting of the astrological attributes of Mars. Mantreshwara might\nas well have gone on to say that someone with Ruchaka Yoga\nwill be fond of confrontations, will be a 'victory-at-any-cost' com-\npetitor, may be accident-prone, will serve in executive and inde-\npendent positions, may be a crusader for various causes, may have\npowerful younger siblings, may be athletic, may be a lawyer, and\nSO on.\n Many people with strong Ruchaka Yogas do end up becoming\nlawyers, but this potential will be actualized only in those horoscopes\ni.. which the fourth house of education (because law requires formal\neducation) and Jupiter (because law requires good judgement) are\nboth strong.

Chart 2's owner does indeed live on a property with a pond,\nand very much enjoys amusements. The same text also states that\nsuch an individual will have full cheeks and a round forehead, two\ncharacteristics which this person does possess.\n Simply because a graha occupies its own or its exaltation constella-\ntion does not create a Pancha Mahapurusha Yoga.

Enterprise alone\n is no guarantee of achievement, nor can chance alone be relied\n upon; but when both combine, the whole truly becomes greater\n than the sum of its parts. Whenever Napoleon was considering\n elevating one of his generals to the rank of marshal, his final\n question, after hearing a litany of the man's achievements and\n qualifications, would reportedly be: 'Yes, but is he lucky?'\n Dharma Karma Adhipati Yogas are examples of Raja Yogas,\ncombinations which promise success, wealth, influence and celebrity.\nA strong Dharma Karma Adhipati Yoga enables a person to rise to\na position of great prominence in society. Although, technically\nspeaking, a Raja Yoga is a combination for political success (a raja\n is a ruler), over the years it has come to promise success, wealth,\ninfluence and/or celebrity. While in the old days the king had the\npower to support and influence all others, today non-political\npeople like writers, actors, musicians and media moguls are often\nmore influential, wealthy and famous than most of our rulers.\n The source of good fortune is the Law of Karma: The total of\nyour past karmas determines what sort of assistance the world will\ngive you. The kendras represent, in a certain sense, your present\nactions, your Kriyamana and Agama Karmas, while the konas\nindicate the overall positivity or negativity of your past actions,\nyour Prarabdha and Sanchita Karmas.

The lagna is particularly\nimportant because it is simultaneously a kona and a kendra. When-\never the lord of a kendra (the husband) and the lord of a kona (his\nwife) unite, opportunity combines with real fortune to create endur-\ning prosperity: a Raja Yoga.\n Here is another way to look at this combination: The kendra\nhouses are sometimes called houses of environment (your objective\nsurroundings) and the trinal houses, houses of merit (your subjective",

The combination of the ninth and\ntenth lords is the strongest Dharma Karma Adhipati Yoga, for the\nninth is the strongest of the konas and the tenth the strongest of the\nkendras. Although a Dharma Karma Adhipati Yoga is defined as a\ncombination by association or mutual aspect between a kona lord\nand a kendra lord, it is also said to be formed when: (a) the lord of\nthe ninth house occupies the ninth house and the tenth lord occupies\nthe tenth house, or when the fourth lord occupies the fourth and the\nfifth lord tenants the fifth.

It is sometimes said that Mars forms Raja Yoga for a\nCancer ascendant only when it is supported by benefics.\n Saturn acts as Raja Yoga Karaka for the ascendants of Venus,\nand Venus returns the favor for Saturn. Symmetry suggests that the\nMoon and Sun, lords of Cancer and Leo respectively, should, when\nconjoined, form a Raja Yoga for the two ascendants of Mars (Aries,\nin which the luminaries own houses 4 and r , and Scorpio, in which\nthey rule 9 and 10). Because whenever the Sun and Moon occupy\nthe same house the Moon's inherent light is exceedingly dim, the\nRaja Yoga formed when the Sun and Moon aspect one another (as\nthey do when the Moon is full or near full) is much stronger than\nis the yoga formed when they conjoin, at the time of the new\nMoon.\n Like any other beneficial yoga, a Raja Yoga gives good results\nwhen it appears in a good house and is without affliction. Consider\na Saturn at z9' in the first house of a Libra ascendant in the\nhoroscope of a person about to enter a period where Saturn will be\nvery influential in her life.

After handling many birth\ncharts you will begin to realize how unusual it is to find two such\nstrong Dharma Karma Adhipati Yogas in one and the same\nhoroscope.\n Experience will also teach you that these and other yogas occur\nin horoscopes with some frequency but with very different strengths.\nBe mindful of Mantreshwara's axiom that the results of good yogas\nbecome certain when the grahas involved are strong and when there\nis a confluence of good influences to the participant planets.

In\nChart I , the two planets involved (Mercury and Venus) sit together\nin the third house, a dussthana; Venus is in the constellation of its\nenemy; and both Mercury and Venus are aspected by the malefic\nSaturn, who is also acting as eighth lord.\n Saturn as the fifth lord joins with Jupiter in Chart 2 to form the\nyoga, so we cannot say that the yoga there is marred by the malefic\nSaturn.

One born in Gaja\nKesari Yoga will be splendorous, wealthy, intelligent, endowed with many\nlaudable virtues, and will please the king. (j6:j-4)\n The lesser combination of Moon and Jupiter in angles to each other is\nin Phaladipika given the simpler name of Kesari Yoga, but even in\nthis watered-down version of the yoga it is still important for\nJupiter and the Moon to be in good houses from the ascendant.\nSince one full third of all horoscopes display Jupiter in a kendra\nfrom the Moon, it is wise to ensure that the combination satisfies\nParashara's more stringent criteria before predicting the results\npromised for the yoga. A Moon in the twelfth house and a debili-\ntated and combust Jupiter in the third house would clearly be very\nunlikely to produce noticeably good results.\n In Chart I the Moon is in the fifth house and Jupiter in the\nsecond house, but, although this Jupiter is in an angle from the\nMoon and is exalted, it is also combust and conjoined with Rahu. In\nthis case no Gaja Kesari Yoga is formed. A Gaja Kesari Yoga, even\nif in good houses from the ascendant, is also unlikely to yield\nbeneficial effects if the Moon is depleted (i.e. if the birth was within\nfive days either side of the new Moon). A good Gaja Kesari Yoga is\nsaid to be particularly useful for politicians.\n This yoga appears almost fully formed in Chart 2, and was the\ncause of the following true story.

Canceled\ndebility does not become equal to an exaltation or some other\ndesirable placement, however. Debility is debility, and Neecha\nBhanga is no more perfect than is a prosthesis applied to a limbless\nbody. Giving a debilitated graha a cane with which to walk will\nenable the graha to exert some beneficial effects but, even if it\nexcels at its duties, it will still never be normal. Moreover, Neecha\nBhanga creates a Raja Yoga on4 when the debilitated graha occupies\na kendra or a kona; otherwise the planet's debility will merely be\nremoved.\n Four of the most important ways in which debility can be\ncanceled are: (I) if the lord of the rashi occupied by the debilitated\ngraha is in a kendra position from the Moon or Lagna; (2) if the\nlord of the rashi where the debilitated graha is exalted is in a kendra\nposition from the Moon or Lagna; (3) if the lord of the rashi\noccupied by the debilitated graha aspects that graha; or (4) if the\nplanet who would be exalted in the rashi occupied by the debilitated\ngraha is in a kendra from the Moon or from the Lagna.\n As an example, take Saturn in Aries. If Mars (I - Saturn's\ndispositor), Venus (2 - lord of Saturn's exaltation rashi) or the Sun\n(4 - who is exalted in Aries) occupies a kendra from the Moon or\nfrom the Lagna, or if Mars aspects Aries (j), Saturn's debility will\nbe canceled.

Usually referred to it1 North and West India as\n'being Mangalik,' Kuja Dosha (as it is usually known in South\nIndia) occurs whenever Mars occupies houses one, two, four, seven,\neight or twelve in a horoscope. It is unique among yogas in that it\nis counted not just from the ascendant but also from the Moon and\nfrom Venus, and is regarded as being particularly virulent when it\nrecurs from all three positions.\n Kuja Dosha is probably the best-known of graha yogas among\nIndia's general public, and many Indians still assiduously avoid\nmarrying anyone with Kuja Dosha. While this yoga originally\nindicated the death of the spouse, it was later modified to mean\nmarital misery. Mangala usually means 'auspicious'; most Indian\nwomen wear wedding necklaces called mangala sz/tras instead of\nwedding rings. But Mangala is also a name for Mars, a violent and\nargumentative graha who does not promote marital harmony when\nconfigured with one of the houses of relationship. While it is said\nthat Mars can sometimes become auspicious for a lucky individual,\nsome jyotishis believe that Mars is called Mangala in honor of all\nthe penances, sacrifices and other auspicious actions a native must\ndo to avert his evil effects.\n Mars in the first house causes Kuja Dosha because of the impor-\ntance of the first house as an epitome of the horoscope, and because\nthe first house, being the seventh house from the seventh house, is a\nsort of derivative of the seventh house. Also, when Mars occupies\nthe ascendant, he aspects both the seventh house (the house of\nmarriage) and the eighth house (the mangaba stbana, or house of the\nduration of married life; the mangala szrtra is its symbol). Mars in the\nsecond house causes Kuja Dosha because the second house both\nrules family life and, being the eighth from the seventh house,\nrepresents the partner's longevity, and because from the second\nhouse Mars aspects both the fifth house of progeny and the eighth\nhouse.",

Marriages contracted by such\n people prior to age twenty-eight usually end unhappily, though\n they will not necessarily end prior to age twenty-eight.\n(3) Mars in its own or exaltation rashi greatly modifies any Kuja\n Dosha position and perhaps even cancels it ('perhaps', because\n the experts disagree on this point).",

Yet another\n group considers Kala Sarpa Yoga to be formed in either way, an\n approach which seems to be verified by experience.\n Two types of Kala Sarpa are thus distinguished: (I) Andoma\n ('normal direction') type - all planets moving toward Rahu; this\n type is less likely to give trouble than is the other; and (2) Vdoma\n ('reverse direction') type - all planets moving toward Ketu, which\ncan cause prosperity but will give troubles side by side.\n The Yoga is still formed even if there are planets conjoined (in\nthe same house) with either Rahu or Ketu or both, so long as these\nplanets are within the nodal axis by degree position; but a 'true' Kala\nSarpa is formed only when the planets are in contiguous constella-\ntions. All five intervening rashis need not be tenanted by planets,\nbut all the planets must clump together. The situation is worse\nwhen the planets are evenly distributed because during their transits\n(see Chapter Eleven) Rahu or Ketu will continuously pass over one\nplanet after another, generating crises as they go. The texts neglect\nto say whether the ascendant must be included in the houses\ncontained within the Serpent's belly (i.e. the houses which are\ntrapped between Rahu and Ketu), or whether there is a way to\ncancel its effects (in the way that debility can be canceled by Neecha\nBhanga Yoga).\n The difficulties created by a Kala Sarpa Yoga typically focus on:\n(a) the houses ruled by any graha that either Rahu or Ketu conjoins,\nor (b) the houses ruled by one or both of the dispositors of Rahu\nand Ketu, or (c) the houses Rahu and Ketu occupy. This is usually\nan eitherlor situation in that one of the above houses is ordinarily a\nvery noteworthy indicator of the problems the Yoga causes. The\nside of the axis that is conjoined with or aspected by malefics will\nusually be worse than the other or, if one of the dispositors is a\nmalefic, the houses that it owns.

Few people live beyond 120 years,\nso there is little chance that a dasha will repeat in any one individual's\nlife. The astrological rulerships of life's diverse ages will therefore\ntend to indicate distinct and unique results, given the wide variations\nin planetary positions from horoscope to horoscope.\n Vimshottari Dasha is also known as Nakshatra Dasha because its\nyears are parceled out, albeit unequally, to each of the nine nakshat-\nras which embody the 120\" of space which is one-third of the\nzodiac. The nine nakshatras from Ashvini to Ashlesha cover the\nconstellations Aries to Cancer, the nine nakshatras from Magha to\nJyeshtha cover the constellations Leo to Scorpio, and the nine from\nMula to Revati cover Sagittarius to Pisces. In the Vimshottari\nsystem, the Vedic rulerships of the nakshatras are replaced with a\nsystem of planetary rulers, and each of the three groups of nine\nnakshatras has an identical sequence of rulers, beginning with Ketu\nand ending with Mercury (as shown in Table I I. I, below). Within\neach of these three cycles each nakshatra is allocated the same fixed\nnumber of years, which is the period of the dasha of that nakshatra's\nplanetary ruler.

The graha who rules that nakshatra is the\nfirst ruler of the native's life, and will continue to rule for that\nportion of the period allocated to it by the Vimshottari Dasha\nsystem, a portion which is proportionate to the distance the Moon\nhas left to traverse within that nakshatra.\n As an example, suppose that someone was born when the Moon\nsat precisely at 16\" 40' of Taurus, which is within the nakshatra\nRohini, which is ruled by the Moon.

First we examine Saturn's house lordship, to\ndetermine whether he is a temporary benefic or malefic for this\nlagna. While Saturn does own the good ninth house, it is also the\nlord of the evil eighth house, so (according to Principles 8 and 9)\nthese lordships will neither subtract from nor improve Saturn's\naspects. But since the fundamental nature of malefics always causes\nthem to retain a flavor of struggle and imperfection, no matter how\ntemporarily benefic they may become, the natural malefic Saturn is\nbound to create some sort of havoc in every horoscope during its\ndasha.\n To see how and where these problems will crop up, we must\nexamine the houses that Saturn occupies, aspects, and owns in the\nhoroscope. Saturn's seat in the first house as a natural malefic will\ndisturb the first house of health (Principle j), and indeed the native\nhas experienced a number of significant health problems during\nSaturn's dasha. Many of these problems involved the bones, which\nSaturn naturally rules, with the specific involvement of some of the\nbones of his neck, a portion of the body ruled by Gemini, which\nSaturn occupies.\n Saturn sits in the ascendant as a natural malefic, so its aspects on\nthe third, seventh and tenth houses disturb those houses (Principle\n3). It was during the period of Saturn that one of this man's\nyounger sisters (third house) died. Severe marital problems (seventh\nhouse) began during this period, which were aggravated by a\nserious deterioration in his wife's health. This led to a brief separa-\ntion, followed by his wife's death. After leaving his job (tenth\nhouse) he tried to go independent, but to date he has lost three\nbusinesses.",

Due to the eighth-\nhouse influence, the native experienced death in the form of the\ntragic demise of his wife and sister; he had several vehicular\naccidents, and one badly broken leg; and he experienced bankruptcy\n(Principle I I). Yet he also traveled widely, took to the serious study\nof scriptures and religious practices, and was initiated by a religious\npreceptor on a pilgrimage to India - all ninth-house matters (Prin-\nciple 10). The results indicated by Saturn owning both the eighth\nand ninth bhavas were thus cumulative and did not cancel. In his\ncase, travel was particularly supported because Saturn's dispositor\nMercury occupies the third house, another travel house, from which\nit aspects the ninth house.\n Finally, while Saturn is unaspected and is not associated with any\nother planet, it does aspect both Mercury and Venus. Saturn as lord\nof the eighth bhava aspecting Mercury, who rules the first and\nfourth bhavas, could for example indicate the 'death' (loss) of\nvehicles or property (fourth house), or an accident to the native\n(first house). Saturn as lord of the ninth aspecting Mercury may\nindicate long-distance travel during Saturn's dasha, and in fact all\nthese matters have been ongoing themes in the native's life during\nthis dasha.\n The influence of eighth- and ninth lord Saturn on Venus (the fifth\nlord) may be interpreted as an influence on the lord of children by\nthe lord of death and the lord of dharma. This may indicate loss of a\nchild, or perhaps a need to fulfill one's dharma in relation to a child.\nBoth interpretations have been accurate during the Saturn dasha:\nafter his wife's death he agonized over making the right decision\nabout his daughter's welfare, finally deciding to lodge her with\nrelatives in a different country, thus becoming permanently sepa-\nrated from her. Here the 'death' of a child was not his daughter's\nphysical death; it was rather her 'death' in relation to him.

The dashas\nenable one to see the forest, and the bbuktis (the smaller periods of\ntime within the dashas) enable one to focus on the trees in that\nforest. The bhuktis (also known as antaras) are minor periods or\nsub-periods within the major planetary period that is a dasha.\nDashas are sometimes called Maha Dashas ('Major Dashas') to\ndistinguish them from bhuktis.\n Bbukti comes from the root word bbuj, meaning 'to enjoy, partici-\npate in, or consume', which harks back to the digestive meanings of\nthe word dasha. Each major period is divided into nine minor\nperiods which are each allotted to one graha, in the same order that\ncharacterizes the dasha. A simple way to determine the length of .a\nbhukti is to employ the so-called Rule of Three: multiply the\nnumber of years allotted in the Vimshottari Dasha to the major\nperiod lord by the number of years allotted to the minor lord, then\ndivide by ten and detach the remainder. The answer indicates the\nnumber of months in the minor period, and when the remainder is\nmultiplied by three that answer indicates the number of days which\nmust be added to the number of months to give the minor period's\ntotal length.\n For example, to calculate the period of Mars within the major\nperiod of Rahu, a period usually expressed in astrological shorthand\nas Rahu-Mars, multiply the 18 years of the Rahu Dasha by the 7\nyears of the Mars Dasha to arrive at 126. Dividing by 10 gives us\n12.6. The 1 2 indicates 1 2 months, and when we multiply 6, the\nremainder, by j we get 18, which means 18 days.

Jupiter-Saturn (the\nminor period of Saturn within the major period of Jupiter) = 16 x\n19 = 304 or j o months and (3 X 4 = 12) 1 2 days, so Jupiter-\nSaturn lasts 2 years, 6 months and 1 2 days.

Therefore the first bhukti in the\n Maha Dasha of the Sun is that of the Sun itself (written Sun-Sun);\n in the major period of Mercury it is Mercury-Mercury, and so on.\n After the initial bhukti, the remaining eight minor periods follow\n the natural order of rulerships in the Vimshottari Dasha, continuing\n with the graha that follows the ruler of the first minor period in this\n natural order. The natural order of the Vimshottari Dasha, as given\nabove, is Ketu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu, Jupiter, Saturn and\nMercury. The major period of the Sun thus has these nine minor\nperiods: Sun-Sun, Sun-Moon, Sun-Mars, Sun-Rahu, Sun-Jupiter,\n Sun-Saturn, Sun-Mercury, Sun-Ketu and Sun-Venus.\n For convenience, Table I I . 3 provides the order and the duration\nof each bhukti within each Maha Dasha.\n Bhukti division proceeds as a sort of process of extracting harmon-\nics, so perhaps a musical analogy may make the subject a bit easier\nto understand. Let us first take each dasha cycle of 120 years to\nequal a scale which covers a full octave (imagining for a moment\nthat each octave contained nine notes instead of the usual seven). A\nscale that goes from A to A will sound very different from one\nwhich goes from C to C, or from F# to F#, because the scale's\ninitial tone (the keynote or tonic) determines the form each of the\nfollowing notes will take. Likewise, to begin your life with the\ndasha of Ketu and end it with Mercury would generate quite a\ndifferent life melody than it would if your life began with the Sun's\nDasha and ended with that of Venus, or if it proceeded from the\nMars Maha Dasha to the Moon Maha Dasha. Each series of dashas\nis like a separate musical key, with its own specific number of flats\nor sharps and its own peculiar flavor. Because each set of bhuktis\nbegins with the minor period of the dasha lord, each set has a\ndifferent progression and thus its own melody within the context of\nthe major period.\n The minor periods are often divided into yet smaller sub-sub-\nperiods, by the same procedure, and these can be subdivided into\nyet smaller sub-sub-sub-periods.

While,\n at least theoretically, a human life can thus be analyzed predictively\n right down to each inhalation and exhalation, only a seer can hope\n to achieve such perfection.\n Theoretically one can use the subsidiary dasha periods for similar\npredictive precision, and accordingly some people nowadays use as\nmany as five levels of dasha division in their predictions.

For the present, in the interest of simplicity and\nmanageability, we will limit our dynamic interpretation to the use\nof major and minor planetary periods.

Determine whether these influences are confluent or conflicting.\nFor example, if the dasha lord happens to be the well-placed lord of\nthe third house of short journeys, and the bhukti lord happens to be\na natural benefic aspecting the third house, there is confluence of\neffect; the native is likely to enjoy pleasurable short journeys during\nthat bhukti periodyf, however, the lord of the minor period\nindicates success at short journeys and the major period lord prom-\nises obstruction to travel, their conflict will make confident predic-\ntion more difficult. Jupiter and Venus, which are both natural\nbenefics, would cause a confluence of benefic factors on any house,\nconstellation or planet which they simultaneously influence. The\nextent and nature of the positive influence during the bhukti of\nVenus within the dasha of Jupiter will depend on the strength of\nthe two grahas.\n Confluence and conflict are of course not confined to the natural\nqualities of the grahas, but extend also to their qualities as temporary\nbenefics and malefics.

Since\n Jupiter could not support its natal position by aspect, was transiting\n a mild dussthana, and was in Saturn's nakshatra, Saturn's malefic\n influence prevailed.\n The last phrase of the verse - '. . . provided that the planet is\nendowed with full strength at the birth time as well' - is exceedingly\n important. If Saturn happens to be transiting Aquarius, it is tempt-\n ing to look at a chart in which Leo rises and a Saturn dasha or\n bhukti is ongoing, and think, 'Oh, Saturn is passing through and\ntherefore activating the seventh house in this horoscope, which\n Saturn happens to own.' You then might predict marriage without\npausing to consider the condition of the natal Saturn. But if at the\ntime of birth Saturn was combust or debilitated, the activation of\nthe seventh house in such a horoscope by transiting Saturn may\npromote marital disharmony, and may even cause divorce. Transiting\nplanets can activate restllts promised in the horoscope, but they cannot change\nthe nature of those results.\n Mantreshwara goes on to say:\nIf the planet whose bhukti is in progress should during the course of his\ntransit pass through his debilitation or enemy's house or become combust,\nthere will be much misery. Should he pass through his own or exaltation\nhouse or be retrograde, the effects will then be good.

If, for\nexample, your moon occupies Aries, your sade sati (Hindi for 'seven\nand a half') will consist of those years during which Saturn wanders\nthrough the constellations Pisces, Aries and Taurus. While the\norigins of this principle of sade sati are unclear, and while it does not\nappear as such in the standard classical texts on Jyotish, it is\nrecognized byell practicing jyotishis, and is superstitiously feared\nby millions of Indians. Like all other factors in a horoscope, sade sati\ndoes not act in isolation; confluence must exist to activate it, and\nappropriate dashas, bhuktis and transits must support it.\n Most people with normal longevity experience sade sati on three\noccasions in their lives, though those who are born in sade sati may\ngo through four such cycles, at intervals of 29: years (on the\naverage). The specific experience of Saturn's passage over the Moon\nwill differ from person to person according to the specific positions\nand interrelations of the planets in the horoscope. Jade sati is\ngenerally a difficult period in one's life, though the specific difficulty\nmay need to be pinpointed in other ways.

These houses will often be unfavorably activated, depending\nboth on Saturn's strength in the natal chart, and on the strength of\nthe transiting Saturn. If Saturn occupies by transit its own or its\nexaltation constellation, it will produce relatively good results for\nthe house it transits, and will reduce the bad results expected for the\nhouses that it activates by aspect. A Saturn which is afflicted natally\nby combustion, debilitation, residence in a trik house, or like\nweakness may give miserable results, as may a Saturn who, even if\nstrong in the natal chart, is weak by its transit position.\n3 Look for conjuence. When a strong natal Jupiter and a strong\ntransiting Jupiter occupy or aspect the same house, positive results\nare more likely to accrue. When a malefic natal Saturn influences a\nhouse, and transit Saturn reactivates that house, negative results\nbecome more certain.\n One example, in Chart 2, involves Jupiter, which transited his\nnatal twelfth house from mid-1991 through mid-1992, from where it\nrestimulated by aspect his strong natal Jupiter in the fourth house.\nDuring this period, Chart 2's owner acquired a new vehicle (one of\nthe matters indicated by the fourth house). Since strong natal\nJupiter aspects the twelfth house, owned by its friend Sun, through\nwhich transit Jupiter was passing, this man's foreign travels (a\ntwelfth-house matter) accelerated noticeably.\n Although this binary principle is used outside the context of\ndashas and bhuktis, it is best used in conjunction with Vimshottari\nDasha. If desirable results are anticipated on the basis of the natal\nplacements of the dasha and bhukti lords during long bhuktis (such\nas Venus-Rahu), such results are more likely to begin during a year\nwhen transit Jupiter stimulates those placements. Similarly, if unde-\nsirable results are anticipated on the basis of the natal placements of\nthe dasha and bhukti lords during long bhuktis, such results are\nmore likely to begin during a year when transit Saturn stimulates\nthose placements.",

There is a potentially detrimental\n Shakata Yoga, since the Moon is in the sixth house from Jupiter\nbut, because the Moon is in a kendra from the lagna, it is cancelled.\n There is however a good Budhaditya Yoga. The Sun and Mercury\noccupy the fifth house of discernment with the Sun as the lord of\nthe lagna. This activates both houses (the first and the fifth) which\nmust be activated for the yoga to give outstanding results. The\neffects of this yoga are enhanced because it recurs from the Moon\nLagna, it is unaffected by any malefics, and it occurs in the beneficial\nconstellation of Sagittarius, whose lord Jupiter (a graha who indi-\ncates wisdom and discernment) occupies its own rashi. Yogananda\nwas known for his sharp mind, his powers of discernment, and his\noratorical abilities (Mercury as lord of speech and of the second\nhouse involved in the Budhaditya Yoga).\n The Moon, lord of the twelfth house of renunciation, seclusion\nand ashramas, occupies the first house (a good house), and the\ntwelfth house is aspected only by the benefic Jupiter. This creates a\nMusala Yoga, which causes difficulties in mundane life but enables\nthe native to make good spiritual progress and tends to lead him to\nreside in foreign countries.

We might predict that his guru would assist him\nbecause of the strong aspect of the benefic Jupiter (acting here in its\nliteral capacity of guru) on the dasha lord Venus.\n Yogananda left India in August 1920 during his ~ u n - ~ u ~Ji t e\nperiod, which lasted from 14 May 1920 to 2 March 1921, probably\nbecause the Sun's dispositor Jupiter aspects the twelfth house of\nimmigration while occupying the eighth house, which is another of\nthe houses of travel. Jupiter thus strongly indicates travel, journeys\nwhich would probably be safe because Jupiter occupies the nakshatra\nof Revati, which promises 'protection, shelter and hospitality while\ntraveling'. The Sun's position in Purva Ashadha would suggest\n'voyages by rivers and seas' to reach his destination.\n If we now take Phaladipika's advice and examine the transits of\nthe dasha and bhukti lords, we discover that during August 1920\nJupiter would have been in the early degrees of Leo, transiting\nYogananda's natal Moon (the lord of the twelfth), and aspecting\nboth the natal Sun in the fifth house and the ninth house of long-\ndistance travel. The dasha lord Sun himself transited the twelfth\nhouse from mid-July to mid-August, and from mid-August to mid-\nSeptember transited Leo, his own rashi, which happens to be\noccupied by the lord of the twelfth house. When bhuktis which\nrepresent travel are thus positively supported by the transits of both\nthe bhukti and dasha lords, travel becomes a certainty. When several\ntrips occur over an extended period of time, the transit of the slower\nmoving of the bhukti and dasha lords will often give some insight\ninto their overall tenor, and the faster moving of those two planets\ncan be used to evaluate individual trips within that larger period.\n Yogananda's interest in spirituality began at an early age, but",

It was during these zj years that he became known as a\n spiritual figure, and that his influence spread extensively. Yogananda\n left his body on 7 March I 95 2 during Rahu-Ketu (26 October 195 I\n to 1 2 November 1952). Rahu is disposited by Mars, who occupies\n the eighth house of the end of longevity, and Ketu occupies the\n third bhava, the other longevity house. The dasha and bhukti of\ntwo malefics connected to these two houses is not at all good for\nlongevity. His end was sudden, which is typical of the action of the\nnodes. At that time transit Ketu occupied the lagna, and Rahu sat\nby transit in the seventh bhava, a maraka house. Seventh lord\nSaturn is a powerful maraka in this horoscope because it occupies\nthe second bhava, another maraka house.\n Jupiter in Yogananda's horoscope tenants his own rashi in the\neighth house, which normally would suggest heightened longevity.\nThat Yogananda died at the relatively young age of 59 is due in part\nto the conjunction of that Jupiter with the malefic Mars, and to the\naspect of the malefic Saturn, the double maraka. This position of\nJupiter was powerful enough to give Yogananda great posthumous\nfame, and may be one reason why his body did not decay for at least\nthree weeks after he died.\nFURTHERMORE While we have confined ourselves here predomi-\nnantly to the principles of interpretation outlined in the chapters\nabove, similar results could have been obtained by other methods of\ninterpretation. For example, remember that in Jaimini Jyotish which-\never planet is most advanced in any constellation is called the\nsignificator of soul (Atma Karaka), and whatever navamsha this\nplanet occupies is called the karakamsba. In Yogananda's horoscope\nthe Atma Karaka is Venus, who by virtue of sitting in Aquarius in\nthe navamsha makes Aquarius the karakamsha. Chapter One, Part\n11, Verse 1 2 of the Jaimini Sutram tells us that such a native will\nperform charitable works, an interpretation which is reinforced by\nJupiter's simultaneous occupation of Aquarius in the navamsha.\nWhen the Arudha Lagna, a numerological principle that Jaimini\napplies to the lagna, is added to this interpretation, it creates the\nequivalent, in Jaimini terms, of the Pravrajya Yogas.",

The\nmore significant yoga in Monroe's chart, the one which was respon-\nsible for her incredible fame, is a very powerful Parvata Yoga, as\ndefined by Phaladipzka. The ascendant lord Moon creates this yoga\nby occupying the seventh house and aspecting the ascendant. Moon's\ndispositor Saturn, while not in his own rashi, is, as noted above,\nvery powerful, and is aspected by his own dispositor, who happens\nto be his friend.\n A Parvata Yoga is said to make a person wealthy (very), charitable\n(she did volunteer to do charitable work), eloquent (in a sense),\nlearned in classical subjects (she studied 'classical' method acting),\nfond of mirth (she was a gifted comedienne), famous (definitely),\nsplendiferous (to most), and the leader of a city (the toast of\nHollywood).

In Monroe's case a weaker Jupiter leaves Venus un-\nchecked, and she lacks Yogananda's rare, powerful renunciate yogas.\nThe result was that Monroe was prepared to play the sexpot. These\nparallel combinations producing different results in the charts of\nMonroe and Yogananda starkly illustrate the difficulties a jyotishi\nencounters when trying to deliver accurate judgements.\nTHE LAGNA A N D B H A V A S Predictions about the moral character of\na person require much experience and sensitivity and cannot be\nblindly made on the basis of a single indication in a chart. In\nMonroe's case, aside from the influences listed above, Rahu's pres-\nence in the twelfth house of bed pleasures strongly indicates intense\nsexual indulgence, for Rahu represents 'cravings that cannot be\nsatisfied'. Fortunately Jupiter's aspect curbed this passion to some\ndegree, for without this cover from Jupiter a twelfth-house Rahu in\nan otherwise afflicted chart can lead to debauchery.\n Monroe's lagna is in Cancer, in Ashlesha nakshatra. The themes\nof tragic death and emotional thinking which are significant indica-\ntions for a Cancer ascendant apply to her exceptionally well. Ashle-\nsha's indications appeared plentifully in her life: she represented\nprimordial sexuality, conducted secret love affairs, was subjected\nto and engaged in major manipulations, cast a hypnotic spell on\nher audiences, and was an expert at illusion. She was a frequent\nuser of poisons (alcohol and barbiturates), and was either killed or\ncommitted suicide with poison. 6\n One of the most important reasons for Monroe's fame was the\nstrength of her lagna. Moon's aspect on the ascendant renders the\nlatter strong, and the Moon is itself strong because Monroe was\nborn less than ten days after the full Moon. Saturn, the lord of the\nMoon Lagna, strengthens that lagna by being in a kendra, exalted,\nretrograde, and aspected by two natural benefics, one of whom,\nVenus, is the Raja Yoga Karaka for the Moon Lagna. Two of\nMonroe's three lagnas are thus strong.",

Since, however, all\n results are cumulative they could not prevent this Saturn from\n bringing tragedy, suffering and death, all matters which are naturally\n ruled by Saturn, especially when he rules the eighth house, into\n Monroe's life.\n Monroe was famed for her beauty, a first-house rulership. Her\n allure may be attributed to the confluence of a number of factors,\n including the occupation by the lagna and the Moon of even-\nnumbered constellations. Both Moon and Venus, the other planet\ncapable of bestowing beauty, occupy kendras, and the strong Moon\naspecting its own rashi in the lagna also bestows beauty, or at least\ncharisma. Saturn's aspect on the lagna, which should have detracted\nfrom her good looks, did not because Saturn occupies a rashi of\nVenus while being aspected by Venus, and disposits the Moon.\nThese two influences cause Saturn to carry the effects of both\nVenus and the Moon to the ascendant.\n One reason why Monroe had no full brothers or sisters is that the\nsibling significators, Mars and Jupiter, occupy the eighth house.\nThe third house of younger siblings is aspected by the natural\nmalefic Mars, the enemy of the third lord Mercury, and Mercury is\ncombust and is aspected by Mars. The eleventh house of elder\nsiblings is also aspected by the malefic Mars, and while the eleventh\nlord Venus occupies a neutral rashi in the desirable tenth house,\nthat tenth house is twelfth to the eleventh, a position which ruins\nthe significations of the living beings indicated by the eleventh.\nVenus is also aspected by the powerfully malevolent Saturn. Thus a\nplanet, in this case Saturn, which may provide immense material\nbenefit through participation in graha yogas can simultaneously\nfunction as a terrible malefic. Understanding this seeming paradox\nis one of the major hurdles that students of Jyotish must cross.\n Neither can an exalted malefic be relied upon to give exclusively\ngood results.

Her formal education extended no further than high school.\nThat she did enjoy luxurious vehicles and accommodations was\npresumably due to the presence of that exalted Saturn (a property\nsignificator) in the fourth house of property, and to the aspect on the\nfourth house of the fourth lord Venus (the significator for vehicles).\nThe nature and specific indications of the grahas involved must always\nbe considered when trying to determine which of the many indications\nof a particular bhava will be activated in a specific horoscope.\n Mantreshwara's principles of negative house analysis help to\nexplain why Monroe had no children. The fifth lord Mars occupies\nthe eighth house of death in its enemy's rashi and in the deadly\nMrita Avastha. Jupiter, the significator of children, also sits in the\neighth house.

His Libra ascendant gave him both a strong\ninterest in politics and an inability to listen to good advice. This\nincapacity to hear contrary opinions prevented Hitler's subordinates\nfrom daring to contradict him, even when his plans were unbal-\nanced. Libra's fashion consciousness may have influenced the stylish-\nness of Nazi paraphernalia like uniforms and swastikas, and the\ntheatricality of goose-stepping and staged mass events.\n Saravali teaches that, as the number of planets configured with\nthe ascendant increases, so does the individual's complexity. Here\nMercury, Sun, Mars and Venus all contributed to Hitler something\nof their nature. Mercury made him an orator and writer, Sun a\npolitician, Venus an artist, and Mars a self-centered military man.\nThe Sun could also have suggested spirituality, but the afflictions to\nthe ninth house discourage that interpretation. The aspect of the\nvery powerful Mars also adds a propensity to injury, rashness,\ncourage and pushiness to this equation.\n One factor which made this man into a maniacal mass-murderer",

The Sun's influence is maximal because it sits within\none degree of its maximum exaltation, in a kendra, configured with\nthe lagna and its lord, and aspected by its powerful friend Jupiter.\nThis puissant, cruel Sun, coupled with the influence of the violent,\ncruel Mars and the effect of the Ugra Nakshatras, contributed\nmightily to Hitler's diabolical megalomania.\n The third house (courage, enterprise and adventure) in this\nhoroscope is strong because it is occupied by its lord, Jupiter. Ketu,\nwhich also dwells in the third, acted like Mars to enhance Hitler's\ncourage, which was undeniable: He was awar d two Iron Crosses 4for bravery during the First World War and, even when wounded\nin the leg, he begged his superior officer to be allowed to stay at the\nfront rather than be transported to a rear-echelon hospital.\n HitIer had a poor record in secular education; he failed even to\nobtain the usual secondary school certificate, and never resumed his\nformal education thereafter. Although his fourth house was aspected\nby its lord Saturn, the grahas which represent education (Mercury\nand Jupiter) influence neither the fourth house nor its lord. In the\nabsence of their influence, other matters of the fourth house came\nto the fore. In Hitler's case they came in the form of property\nownership, which Saturn represents. That he was actively interested\nin learning despite his limited secular educational attainments was\ndue to the strength of his Budhaditya Yoga.\n As with Monroe's chart, Hitler's seventh house of romantic\npartnerships and fourth house of morals are influenced by Venus,\nMars and Saturn. In Hitler's case this is because Venus occupies a\nrashi of Mars in the seventh house and is conjoined with Mars as\nlord of the seventh, and both are aspected by Saturn as lord of the\nfourth. This spells moral deficiency, as is evident from what we know of\nHitler's intimate relationships. For example, Hitler was almost twenty",

Geli committed suicide in September 193I .\n Hitler lost his bastard father at age fourteen. The ninth house of\nfather is occupied by Rahu, and the aspect of the Moon is not very\nhelpful on two counts: it is waning, anrl it carries the influence of\nSaturn, the only planet that occupies the Moon's constellation of\nCancer. (This same principle was applied, in the reverse direction,\nto Saturn's carrying the influence of the Moon in Monroe's chart.)\nJupiter's benefic aspect on the ninth house is not really that benefic,\nbecause it owns two dussthanas. Jupiter as a natural benefic may\nhave made the father moral (the father's subjective reality), but\nJupiter as the lord of evil houses contributed to removing him from\nHitler's life early on (Hitler's objective reality).

As we explained in Chapter Four, it is the planet\nwith the higher latitude which wins such a fight. In this horoscope\n while Venus has a higher longitude than Mars (which has led most\ncommentators to assert that it won the war) it is Mars who has the\n higher latitude. Mars therefore defeats Venus, which is one very\nimportant reason why Mars so dominates this horoscope.\n It is also a powerful reason why Hitler suffered from a very deep\npsychological malaise, and why he was ultimately defeated by the\nAllies, for it was Venus acting as the lord of his ascendant who was\nvanquished by another planet. Hitler could never feel content with\nhis many successes, nor ever felt a victory to be complete until it\nhad been proved by conflict, for he, in the person of his vanquished\nlagna lord, always felt defeated by that mighty Mars. It is because a\nvanquished planet gives dangerous results, according to what it\nactivates in the horoscope, that Hitler's death occurred during the\nVenus Bhukti of his Rahu Maha Dasha, since Venus owns and\ntherefore activates in his chart the first house of life and the eighth\nhouse of the end of longevity. Because Venus occupies the seventh\nhouse of spouse, Hitler's romantic companion of many years, Eva\nBraun, also died during this bhukti.\n It was in fact this defeat of Venus at the hands of Mars which\ncaused Hitler to choose war over art. It was heart-rending for Hitler\nwhen, after living the life of a struggling artist in Vienna during his\nearly twenties, he was twice turned down in his bid to enter the\nAcademy of Fine Arts there, and only on volunteering for the army\nin the First World War did his life start to come together. As his\nbiographer John Toland says of him then, 'He earned the respect of\nhis comrades and officers. He belonged.'

This is\nunusual, since different horoscopes typically yield significantly differ-\nent results. The debate among jyotishis over which lagna is correct\ncontinues in India to this day.

The first houses of all three\nlagnas participate in Parivartana Yogas, which is indeed notable.\n A strong Maha Bhagya Yoga occurs from the Cancer ascendant\nalone. This yoga is the reverse of Hitler's, since Gandhi is a woman:\nan even constellation rising, the Sun and Moon in even constellations,\nand birth at night. Even the lords of the various lagnas predominantly\noccupy even constellations, thereby enhancing the yoga's overall\nstrength and impact. A strong Maha Bhagya Yoga makes one a lord of\nthe earth (i.e. a political leader), as it did for Hitler.\n The Dharma Karma Adhipati Yoga created by Sun and Jupiter\nwhich occurs in the Leo lagna is not matched in the Cancer\nascendant.

Among the undesirable\n yogas we find a Papakartari Yoga, which exists only from the\n Cancer lagna by virtue of Mars and Ketu hemming in the first\n house. Since, except for Bhangas, graha yogas do not cancel one\n another out, but rather operate side by side with other combinations,\n the Papakartari Yoga suggests a Cancer lagna by clearly pointing to\nthe many troubles in her life. Her father, who was born in Cancer\nlagna, also had a Papakartari Yoga to offset his many other\ngreatness-producing yogas. He, like his daughter, was jailed, and he\nsuffered many a setback to his career and life.\nTHE LAGNA AND B H A V A S Both the Moon and Sun Lagnas are\nstrong, since they are aspected by their respective lords. While\neither a Cancer or a Leo lagna would be strong, on reviewing the\nmeanings provided for Leo lagna, one is struck with how literally\nmany of them apply to Gandhi's life. She was during her time the\n'one lioness' in the jungle of Indian politics; formed the ministry in\nvarious governments; had no younger siblings; produced only two\noffspring, both of whom died tragically and violently; ruled her\nmarriage; and had an important man (Jawaharlal Nehru, the first\nPrime Minister of independent India) for her father. Since a lagna in\nearly Leo would occupy Magha nakshatra, Magha's symbol of a\nthrone room also reflects her pre-eminent political position and\nimpeccable family pedigree.\n Cancer as lagna with Ashlesha rising provides some strong correla-\ntion as well, the most striking being that Gandhi's life was touched\ndramatically by highly publicized deaths. Her mother, to whom she\nwas very close, died when Gandhi was only 18; when she was 24\nMotilal Nehru, her famous grandfather in whose home she had\nlived most of her younger life, died; Mahatma Gandhi, who was an\nintimate though unrelated associate of Indira Gandhi's family, was\nassassinated when she was 30; her husband died, after 18 years of\nmarriage, when she was 43; her famous father died suddenly when\nshe was 47; her younger son, Sanjay, died in an air crash when she\nwas 63; and she herself was assassinated at 67.",

Cancer could also account for\nher domestic side, which bloomed during the nearly two decades\nthat she acted as the successful official hostess for her Prime\nMinister father, who was a widower.\n One meaning which correlates with Ashlesha rising is secret\nintrigue and manipulation. Another is 'insight and wisdom, coupled\nwith painful separations or serious troubles in life'. Indira Gandhi\nusually knew exactly which way the political winds were blowing,\nbut this knowledge often required her to make unpopular decisions\nwhich came back to haunt her. One dramatic example of this was\nher declaration of a state of emergency, which was followed a few\nyears later by a crushing electoral defeat which removed her from\npower. Another was her ordering of an army attack on a Sikh holy\nsite to dislodge a group of Sikh militant murderers, which was\nrevenged not long thereafter by her assassination at the hands of a\ntrusted Sikh bodyguard.\n Her life seems to correlate better with the indications of Leo and\nMagha, but a Cancer lagna would be slightly stronger than a Leo\nlagna because it receives the aspect of its lord, the Moon. Turning\nto the bhavas, one of the strongest memories the world has of\nGandhi is the fact that she died an unnatural, premature death from\nan assassin's bullets.

Only a\n Cancer ascendant for Indira Gandhi would create the following\n combinations for unnatural death: (a) the eighth lord, who happens\n to be the malefic Saturn, tenants the ascendant in an enemy's rashi\n unrelieved by the influence of any strong benefic; and (b) the same\n malefic lord of the eighth house aspects the lord of the ascendant,\n who is its enemy. This is strong testimony for the lagna being\n Cancer.\n Gandhi had no brothers or sisters. From a Leo lagna the third\n house of siblings is ruled by Venus, who occupies a kona but in the\n house of its enemy, and is conjoined with the malefic Rahu. From\n Cancer the third lord is Mercury, who also occupies its enemy's\n constellation and who is aspected by the natural malefic Mars. It is,\n however, more severely afflicted than its Leo lagna counterpart,\n Venus, because Mercury is additionally combust. The third house\n from Cancer is also aspected by the malefic Saturn. Taken together,\n Cancer offers a greater astrological testimony for no siblings at all\n than does Leo.\n If we take the eleventh house to rule older siblings, the Cancer\n lagna's eleventh house again portrays the absence of older siblings\n more convincingly than does its Leo counterpart. For the latter\n lagna, Mercury becomes the eleventh lord; while for the Cancer\n lagna, the eleventh lord becomes Venus. Although we have just\n concluded that Venus is better positioned, from the view of the\n third house, in a Leo lagna, in the Cancer lagna Venus occupies a\n dussthana (the sixth) while simultaneously residing in the eighth\n from the eleventh. The presence of the natural benefic Jupiter in the\n eleventh house may deny older siblings since, when a significator\n occupies the house it signifies, it creates problems for the living\n being that house signifies. This reinforces the idea that Cancer may\n be the lagna.\n Gandhi believed formal education to be a waste of time. She tried\n to attend Oxford, but left without a degree after flunking several\n subjects, some for the second time. The fourth house from a Cancer\n lagna is unoccupied and unaspected, while its lord Venus resides in\n the sixth house in its enemy's rashi.

This\nfourth house is also influenced by the two education planets,\nMercury and Jupiter. Because this all augurs well for secular educa-\n tion, Cancer is a better choice for the lagna, since Gandhi never\ncompleted college.\n This fourth-house reasoning also applies to Gandhi's tubercular\nmother, whose delicate health contributed to her early death. Gandhi\nwas angered by the fact that her mother never really achieved a\ncomfortable position of dignity and respect in the Nehru household.\nThis again validates the Cancer ascendant, since the fourth house in\na Leo ascendant would promise more in the way of dignity, health\nand longevity to the mother.\n Gandhi had two sons and no daughters. Only from the Cancer\nlagna are the fifth house of children and its lord influenced predomi-\nnantly by male factors: here the fifth house being occupied by Sun\nand aspected by Mars and Jupiter (all male planets), and the fifth\nlord Mars occupying a male rashi uninfluenced by any female\nplanets (Mercury here will act like the male planets which influence\nit). From a Leo lagna the fifth house is influenced by Venus and\nRahu, two female grahas, while the fifth lord Jupiter although\naspected by the masculine Sun occupies a female rashi.\n The Cancer Lagna also supports the pre-eminence her sons\nattained (one of them eventually became India's Prime Minister).\nThis is attributable to the Parivartana Yoga involving houses two\nand five from Gandhi's lagna, which become houses one and ten\nwhen we rotate her horoscope to make her fifth house into the first\nhouse for her first-born son. While the Parivartana Yoga for the\nfifth house from the Leo lagna occurs between good houses (five\nand ten), and when the chart is rotated, the yoga now occurs\nbetween houses one and six (as counted from the fifth house), a\nposition which is not as good as the position from Cancer.\n By taking the fifth house of the Cancer ascendant as the lagna, we\nfind that the new eighth lord is combust in the (now) first house,\nwhere it is aspected by the violent Mars.

Since one son died in a plane crash\nand the other by an assassin's bomb, both causes of death can be\nconsidered to be due to fire and heat. This is not evident from a\nLeo lagna, where the fifth lord Jupiter occupies Rohini.\n Gandhi's marriage confirms Cancer lagna from yet another dimen-\n sion. Her married life, though not smooth, did continue for eighteen\nyears, ending with her husband's untimely death from his second\nheart attack. In this lagna the seventh lord aspects its own house\nwhile occupying a kendra, and the seventh house is aspected by the\nnatural benefic Jupiter. The Cancer ascendant likes to keep its\nmarried life secret, and Gandhi regularly denied allegations that her\nmarried life was troubled, claiming to be happy with her mate\nexcept for their decidedly different opinions on politics.\n The marital discord that eventually did surface is partly attribut-\nable to the position of Venus, the principal significator of marriage,\nin the sixth house, conjoined with Rahu, in which position it sits in\nthe twelfth from the seventh house of marriage. Also significant is\nthe fact that the seventh house is strongly configured with Saturn, a\nplanet who does not indicate marital happiness, all other factors\nbeing equal.

This makes sense only from the Cancer lagna,\nin which the seventh lord participates in a desirable Parivartana\nYoga.

He will always be tormented by his enemies,\nwill speak woundingly and will be unsteady in mind. Interruptions\nwill arise to all his undertakings.' Although this Parivartana Yoga\nraised her up, it concurrently caused problems because it belonged\nto the daitya (lowly) class.\n Indira Gandhi attained power for the first time in 1966, during\nJupiter-Sun, and within the remaining four years of Jupiter's main\nperiod, which were her first four years in power, she faced all sorts\nof major problems, including two wars. During Saturn's dasha she\nexperienced both major advancements and major difficulties in her\ncareer, losing power once and then staging a miraculous comeback.\nSaturn does participate in a desirable Parivartana Maha Yoga, but also\nproduces problems for the Cancer ascendant because it is a natural\nmalefic which aspects Gandhi's tenth house into its debilitation rashi.\n Indira Gandhi married on 26 March 1942, during Rahu-Saturn.\nRahu is conjoined with Venus, the significator of marriage for either\nlagna, but only for the Cancer rising chart is Rahu in the constellation\nof a dispositor (Jupiter, whose results Rahu will give in either chart)\nwho is related to the seventh house, in this case by aspecting it. Both\ncharts would have the bhukti lord Saturn ruling the seventh house\nof marriage, yet marriage seems more likely for the Cancer than for\nthe Leo lagna, since in the Leo ascendant Rahu is not connected",

If the rising drekkana\nhappens to be a Sarpa [snake] drekkana . . . and if the constellation\nowning the drekkana is aspected by malefics, the person will suffer\nimprisonment.'\n The drekkana (one-third division) divides the 3oo of a rashi into\nthree 10\" segments. Each of the drekkanas in the zodiac is named\naccording to its innate qualities. Among the Sarpa drekkanas are\ntwo portions of Cancer: roo to roo, and 20' to 30°. No Sarpa\ndrekkana or other imprisoning drekkana is to be found in Leo.\nWith a late Cancer ascendant, Indira Gandhi would have been born\nin the drekkana of Pisces, who is aspected by the natural malefic\nMars. This combination landed her in jail for her political activities\ntwice during her lifetime, once at the hands of the British and once\non the orders of her own countrymen. Not everyone with this\ncombination will land in jail, of course, nor does every jailbird have\nthis precise combination; but the Papakartari Yoga which hems in\nthe Cancer lagna made this more likely.\n In conclusion, while several of the meanings of Leo and Magha\n\ninitially seemed to fit and might have led us to jump to a conclusion,\nanalysis of the bhavas and the specifics of planetary placement and\nlordship from each of the ascendants yielded a picture in which\nCancer emerged as the more likely ascendant. This demonstrates yet\nagain that general interpretations, like those of the lagnas minus the\nplanets, must always remain subordinate to specific interpretations\nin which the actual planetary positions in a particular chart are\ntaken into account.",

The four other Dharma Karma\nAdhipati Yogas in Einstein's birth chart consist of the conjoining of\nthe lords of houses I and j, 4 and j, I and 9, and 4 and 9.

The Malavya\nYoga, which recurs from all three ascendants, is strong because\nVenus is not combust. Among the many other yogas there is a\nKesari Yoga and a Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga.\n The Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga improves the significations of\nMercury, which is one of two debilitated (neecba) planets in this\nchart.

    "output": "Einstein's Budhaditya Yoga was blemished to some. extent by\n Mercury's debility. The Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga was one compen-\n sating factor. Another is that the Budhaditya Yoga recurs from the\nMoon Lagna; and a third is that Mercury, as a participant in the\nBudhaditya Yoga, occupies Uttara Bhadrapada, a nakshatra which\ncan stimulate extraordinary abilities or awareness. It is likely to do\nso here because Mercury is a key planet in so many of the afore-\nmentioned yogas. A fourth reason is that the Budhaditya Yoga is\nconjoined with Venus, the lord of the fifth house of intelligence,- who\n is less than I \" away from its maximum exaltation in the tenth\nhouse. Moreover, the fifth house in the Moon Lagna is exceptionally\nwell placed because it contains the Budhaditya Yoga, contains an\nexalted planet, and is involved in a Parivartana Yoga.\n It may be that the Budhaditya Yoga is only a supportive factor,\nand that the prime indicator of Einstein's intelligence is this strength\nof the fifth houses of both the ascendant and the Moon Lagna. We\nfind support for this idea in Mahadeva's Jataka Tatva, which\nsuggests that when a benefic as lord of the fifth occupies a kendra\nor kona and is strong there in a benefic's rashi and is influenced by\nthe 'thinking' planets (Jupiter and Mercury) the native will have\ngreat intelligence. This is a more insightful explanation than that set\nforth by those who assert that Neecha Bhanga makes a planet\nperform even better than it would if not debilitated.\n Einstein's horoscope also contains a Pravrajya Yoga, for four or\nmore planets occupy a single house. Because this yoga has some\nimperfections (i.e., two of the planets involved are combust; see\nBrihat Jataka I j :2) and is not supported elsewhere in the horoscope,\nhe did not go the route of a full-fledged ascetic. He did, however,\nshow many ascetic characteristics.\n One final yoga to consider here is a Saraswati Yoga, a combina-\ntion for knowledge. By definition this combination requires that\nVenus, Jupiter and Mercury all be strong in a kendra, a kona, or the\nsecond house. In Einstein's chart all are in a kendra or a kona, with\nVenus strong by exaltation, Jupiter strong because of the Parivartana\nYoga in which it participates, and Mercury being modestly strong\nbecause of all of the yogas in which it participates, particularly the\nNeecha Bhanga Raja Yoga.",

One reason why he became one of\nthe world's archetypes for intellect is that the numerous yogas in his\nchart are supported by the Sun's rulership of the third house\n (intellect) in a Gemini lagna. Gemini being a dual rashi, with its\nlord in the tenth house in a dual rashi, Einstein had varied career\ninterests. He adopted different countries as home at different stages\nof his life because lagna lord Mercury is also lord of the fourth\nhouse. His health, especially from age jo onward, was delicate, and\nat times a serious problem, as his lagna would suggest.\n His religious interest was, as is typical for Geminis, mainly an\nintellectual analysis of spiritual insights. Einstein himself wrote, 'I\nhave not found a better expression than \"religious\" for the trust in\nthe rational nature of reality that is, at least to a certain extent,\naccessible to human reason' (Clark, p. 502). Nevertheless, the\nstrength of his ninth house caused Einstein to be more inched to\nspiritual matters than are many Geminis.\n Einstein's rising nakshatra was Ardra, whose meanings do not fit\nvery well with his life experiences. If, however, we add a mere three\nminutes to his birthtime, his lagna point enters Punarvasu, whose\ndescriptions seem much more appropriate to him. Punarvasu sup-\nports Einstein's tendency to frequent journeys and public involve-\nment even while remaining substantially aloof from the world. In\nthe last twenty years of his life he traveled very little and lived,\nwhenever possible, a life of solitude, a tendency which was rein-\nforced by the Pravrajya Yoga. Nakshatras can be very useful for\nsuch minor rectification of birthtimes, particularly those which we\nsuspect may have been rounded up or down.\n All three of Einstein's lagnas are rather strong. The ascendant is\naspected by the benefic Jupiter, and lagna lord Mercury, who\noccupies a kendra, participates in many yogas. These factors more\nthan compensate for Mercury's wide combustion, and the Neecha\nBhanga Raja Yoga takes the edge off its debilitation.

Varahamihira dubs the person with Saturn in\nAries 'a fool' on account of the natural malefic Saturn occupying\nthe constellation which represents the brain; 'deceitful', because a\n fallen Saturn displays its worst qualities; 'always on his legs',\nbecause Saturn rules Capricorn and Aquarius, the constellations\nwhich indicate the legs, so that a weak Saturn will be detrimental to\nthe legs; and 'without friends', because Saturn rules the eleventh\nhouse of the natural zodiac and as such cannot give good friends\nwhen he is debilitated.\n Similar rules of interpretation apply for planets in combination\nwith one another. When Mercury is associated with or aspected by\nMars, all matters ruled by Mercury will be weakened, because Mars\nis a malefic; because Mercury rules speech, such a person may well\nspeak badly, or tell lies. On the other hand, the things which Mars\nrepresents will be blended in with Mercurial matters.

Some\ntraditional astrological works suggest that such a combination will\nindicate a logician who is skilled in debate. Since the second house\nrelates more to speaking than to athletics, this seems a more logical\nindication than boxing.\n But suppose this association of Mars and Mercury takes place in\nthe second house in the constellation of Cancer, where Mars is\ndebilitated and Mercury is in the constellation of its enemy. Such a\nnative is less likely to be a great logician and debater than an\nimpulsive and illogical speaker whose hasty words cause antagonism.",

The key to deciding which\nline of interpretation to follow in any particular instance lies in\nevaluating all factors of the combination simultaneously: the house\nand constellation in which the combination lies, the natures and\nrulerships of the grahas that compose it, the effect of other grahas\non the combination, and the native's environment and cultural\ncontext.\n While this style of interpretation is relatively straightforward in\ntheory, it becomes very involved in practice. Mistakes occur because\nit is not always humanly possible to consider every pertinent\ninfluence in the chart. The seers who gave us Jyotish tried to\nsimplify things for us by emphasizing graha yogas.

It was during the dasha of Venus that he\nobtained academic credentials, by way of a scientific paper that\nbarely earned him a doctorate at the age of 26. Because Venus\ncreates a Malavya Yoga in the tenth house as lord of the fifth and\ntenth bhavas, the Venus Dasha caused him to think more about his\nlife work, and gave him some limited recognition as a free-thinking\nphysicist. It also brought him children and marriage.\n The Sun's Maha Dasha brought Einstein more fame, since the\nSun occupies the tenth bhava of fame with directional strength as\nthe natural significator of fame and as the ruler of the third house\n(mind). During these six years he produced some of his most\nbrilliant work. But only during the planetary period of the Moon\ndid he win the Nobel Prize, during the sub-period of Mars.\n The Moon's grand results are difficult to explain, since it lies\ndebilitated in the sixth house.

Secondly, his horoscope has been re-\nsearched by many competent jyotishis who have found no need to\nquestion its authenticity.

This meaning\n did not apply to Ramakrishna's life at all, partly because of the\n Pravrajya Yogas, which are conspicuously absent in Monroe's chart,\n partly because of the different planets and houses activated in the\n. two charts, and partly because of the condition of the grahas thus\n activated.\n In Monroe's chart Saturn owns the seventh bhava (desire) and\n the eighth bhava (infamous activities, including brazen sex), and\n occupies the fourth bhava (morals). We choose 'desire', 'infamous\n activities' and 'morals' from among the many meanings of those\n bhavas because these choices reflect the influence of Venus, who\n aspects Saturn. Saturn does receive the aspect of Jupiter as well, as\n in Ramakrishna's chart, but Monroe's Jupiter is not as strong as it\n is in Ramakrishna's chart, where it is strengthened by being retro-\n grade, by occupying Yuva Avastha, by occupying a kona, and by\n failing to own a dussthana.

In Monroe's chart, Saturn influences\nboth the ascendant and the lord of her Sun Lagna, and both of the\n latter are without the moral influence of Jupiter. Saturn can, by its\noccupation of a rashi of Venus in both charts, create some concern\nover the native's morality. This concern in Ramakrishna's chart,\nalready alleviated by the foregoing considerations, becomes even\nless of a concern when we see that Venus has become particularly\nbenefic. Venus owns two good bhavas (being the Raja Yoga\nKaraka for all three of his lagnas) and occupies a rashi owned by\nthe noble-minded Jupiter. In Monroe's chart, this same dispositor\nof Saturn occupies a rashi of Mars, whence it aspects Saturn\nreciprocally as lord of another bhava of desire (the eleventh).\n Ramakrishna's Saraswati Yoga is extremely powerful and notewor-\nthy, since the grahas who create it - Venus, Jupiter and Mercury -\nare all powerful in the second bhava, a kona and a kendra respec-\ntively. Mercury is strong by directional strength and by being\nretrograde, Jupiter is strong by retrogression, and Venus is strong\nby being exalted.

In Ramakrishna's chart, the Durud-\nhara Yoga created by Venus occupying the second house and Mars\nthe twelfth house from the Moon is noteworthy because the exalted\nVenus as lord of the ninth bhava will strengthen the native's\ndharma, religion and higher knowledge and, as lord of the fourth\nbhava, will strengthen morality.

Venus's involvement in other yogas causes its presence\n to infuse the Durudhara Yoga with greater energy, and vice\n versa, according to the principle that a graha gains strength as it\n participates in yogas.\n Ubhayachari Yoga, which is formed by Venus in the second and\nMars in the twelfth houses as counted from the Sun, further\n strengthens Venus. Although Mars's exaltation makes both this and\n the Durudhara Yoga valuable, Mars was less influential in Rama-\n krishna's life than was Venus because Mars does not participate in\nany other major yogas in the chart. The exalted Mars does, however,\nactivate the twelfth bhava of moksha, thus reinforcing the effects\npromised by the exaltation and the Shasha Yoga of the twelfth lord\n(who also happens to rule the lagna, which personalizes the effect).\n It is because of the presence of the Pravrajya Yogas and the other\nstrong spiritual themes in his horoscope that we do not interpret\nthese combinations in typically mundane ways. These spiritual\ninfluences caused, for example, Venus's strength as fourth lord to\nappear in his life as strong moral development instead of as a Rolls\nRoyce, and caused Mars's strength in the twelfth house to contribute\nto moksha and not to highly speculative investments in real estate.\n Among the twenty-four Yogas referred to in Chapter Ten, the\nauspicious yoga for the ascendant known as Chamara Yoga is created\nbecause the first house is aspected by the powerfully benefic Jupiter,\nwhile its lord Saturn is strongly situated in a kona.

In particular, he was\n an ascetic engaged in strong devotional practices. This signification\n especially came to the fore because the ascetically inclined Saturn\n rules the lagna. The luxury-loving Venus as lagna lord in Swati\nwould yield a quite different sort of interpretation.\n All three of Ramakrishna's lagnas fall in Aquarius, which renders\nmany of the meanings of the ascendant and the nakshatra occupied\nby the ascendant lord particularly strong. More signiticantly, all\nplanetary placements in such a chart are totally aligned. This power-\nfully aligns soul, mind and body, which causes speech, thought and\naction always to tend to function in harmony. All three lagnas\nbecome exceptionally strong in Ramakrishna's horoscope because\n Saturn, the lord of all three, is exalted in the auspicious ninth bhava,\nwhere it is not hampered by the association or aspect of any malefic.\n Saturn's dispositor Venus is also exalted, which strengthens Saturn\nfurther, particularly because Venus is the Raja Yoga Karaka for all\nthree lagnas.

While fourth lord Venus is exalted in the second house,\nwhich would suggest education, the education planets Mercury and\nJupiter fail to influence the fourth bhava, and so fail to support this\ninterpretation. This exaltation of the fourth lord is more likely to\nhave produced exalted happiness, for example, which the fourth\nbhava also represents.\n Ramakrishna's chart shows the beneficial fifth-house combination\ncalled Chatra Yoga, which is supposed to give keen wit, intelligence,\nan ability to give good advice, and also children (all fifth-house\nmatters). The Pravrajya Yogas make children unlikely, an interpreta-\ntion which is compounded by the presence of the ~ignificato~of\nchildren in the house of children (according to Principle of Interpre-\ntation j). Note also that the fifth bhava falls in Gemini, a barren\nrashi whose lord Mercury is a neuter among the grahas. In this\nchart Mercury occupies the semi-fruitful rashi Aquarius, and the\nneuter nakshatra Shatabhisha. Perhaps Shatabhisha's symbol, an\nempty circle, alludes here to zero children, given the other confluent\nfactors which do not support offspring.\n Students or disciples are often more appropriate fifth-house signifi-\ncations for a spiritual teacher than are children, and Ramakrishna\ndid have spiritual children, whom he loved as intensely as any\nmother ever loved her child.

This is\n precisely the combination that creates Chatra Yoga, which is also\n said to produce powerful disciples; in fact, another meaning for\n Chatra is 'pupil'. That Ramakrishna would produce a brilliant\n disciple is suggested by Jupiter and Mercury, the two mental and\n educational planets which form the Chatra Yoga. They are particu-\n larly strong for this purpose because they reinforce one another,\n since Jupiter occupies a rashi of Mercury while also aspecting\nMercury. This sort of strong reciprocal relationship is called in\n Sanskrit sambandba.\n On rotating the horoscope to make Gemini, Ramakrishna's fifth\nhouse, into the ascendant of the disciple's chart thus created, we\nfind Mercury, lagna lord of this new chart, involved in a powerful\nBudhaditya Yoga in the ninth bhava. The strength of Mercury in\nthe ninth house suggests that this disciple would travel the world,\nwhile Saturn, the lord of the ninth bhava in the student's chart, is\nexalted in the ninth from that ninth (see Bbauat Bbauam in Chapter\nSix). Because of all these influences we feel justified in interpreting\nShatabhisha's symbol of an empty circle as a reflection of\nVivekananda's dedication to the Formless Absolute, which is some-\ntimes called sbt/n_ya (literally, 'zero').\n Despite being a life-long renunciate and celibate, Ramakrishna\nbowed to cultural convention sufficiently to marry. But his marriage\nwas never consummated, and his wife treated him as her guru, not\nher husband. They remained 'married' in this way throughout their\nlives. In Ramakrishna's chart, the seventh lord aspects the seventh\nbhava, which is always a desirable influence, and that seventh lord\nis in turn aspected by the powerfully benefic Jupiter. Yet it is also\naspected by the lord of the sixth house who, being the Moon, is not\ntempered in its malefic house rulership by simultaneously owning a\nbeneficial house. The seventh bhava is also aspected by the powerful\nnatural malefic Mars, and the lord of the seventh house occupies the\nneuter nakshatra Shatabhisha, the 'empty circle'.

Few jyotishis are likely to have foreseen the unusual circum-\n stances surrounding his marriage, though a gifted Tantric jyotishi\nwith some siddhi (superhuman ability) might in a moment of inspira-\n tion have been able to do so. No matter how perfectly we may be able\nto engineer Jyotish's principles, they must always be empowered by\nthe consciousness of the jyotishi.\n The spiritual bhavas of Ramakrishna's chart (the ninth and\ntwelfth) dominated much of his life. These two houses are really\nhouses of potential spirituality; they take on this meaning only when\nthe general tenor of the horoscope suggests a spiritual theme, as for\nexample when Pravrajya Yogas exist. Otherwise, these two houses\nusually represent more prosaic matters. In Ramakrishna's case,\nauspicious spiritual karmas of a fixed nature prevailed for a variety\nof reasons. Two of these are that the ninth bhava contains the\nexalted lagna lord Saturn, whose dispositor is also exalted; and that\nthe twelfth house contains an exalted planet whose dispositor is also\nexalted in, of all places, the ninth house.\n When a graha's body (deha) and soul (jiua) are both so mighty,\nsuperlative results for the matters of the houses involved become\ninevitable, particularly because nvne of the planets involved is\nweakened by the influence of malefics, and because Saturn is\nsupported by the strong aspect of the exclusively benefic Jupiter.\nBecause striking combinations like these, desirable or undesirable,\ndisplay karma which is clearly fixed, we can confidently assert that\nRamakrishna was born ripe to experience his spiritual insights.\n Although we might also conclude that his powerful ninth house\nshould have given Ramakrishna a great deal of foreign travel, he\nnever left India. The main reason for this state of affairs is probably\nthat all three of his lagnas occupy a fixed rashi (Aquarius), which\ngave a fixity to his life. The travel effect was felt closer to home,\nhowever, in that he made long-distance (for that era, in which travel\nwas often difficult) pilgrimages, a variety of travel which is most\nappropriate both for the ninth house itself and for the overall\nspiritual nature of his horoscope.\nD A S H A S A N D B H U K T I S Ramakrishna was born with some I 3 years",

It was during\n this cycle that he began to have strong spiritual experiences, since\nthe strong and spiritually inclined benefic Jupiter in the fifth bhava\naspects all three lagnas as well as lagna lord Saturn and the ninth\nbhava. Even as a young child the most innocuous events in his life,\nlike watching cranes fly through a cloudy sky, would bring on\nmystical experiences.\n It was during the I 9 years of his Saturn Maha Dasha, from age I 3\nto 32, that he enjoyed his peak spiritual experiences. This was to be\nexpected, given the strong placement of Saturn for spiritual matters\nin the ninth bhava. He then experienced his Mercury dasha until the\nage of 49. Mercury as lord of the fifth bhava in the lagna for all\nthree ascendants while retrograde and with directional strength, and\nas a participant in various yogas, suggests accurately that his reli-\ngious experiences would continue. This chart illustrates beautifully\nhow important it is to enjoy a beneficial dasha at the appropriate\ntime in one's life.\n One interesting verification of our conclusion that Ramakrishna\nwas born with Dridha Karma for spiritual life occurred during his\nSaturn Maha Dasha. In late 1864 Ramakrishna met one of his\nteachers, Tota Puri, who instructed him in Advaita Vedanta and in\nthe practice of formless ecstasy (niruikalpa samadhi), a state that\neludes many aspirants even after a lifetime of keen practice. Rama-\nkrishna achieved this state in one day, for he was a spiritual\nprodigy, just as Mozart was a musical prodigy. The strong spiritual\nplacement of the planet Saturn enables us to predict that such\nresults would be enjoyed during his Saturn Maha Dasha.\n Ramakrishna actually attained to niruikalpa samadhi during his\nSaturn-Rahu period. Rahu as a bhukti lord will mainly give the\neffects of its dispositor Venus, the exalted lord of the ninth bhava\nwho is the strongest of the grahas which influence Rahu. Bhukti\nlord Rahu was transiting dasha lord Saturn's natal position in the\nninth bhava at the time of this experience, and Saturn himself had\nreturned to its exalted natal position to reinforce by transit what he\nhad promised natally. During the Saturn-Jupiter period Rama-\nkrishna experienced further blissful states, to whose influence he\noften succumbed in swoons of spiritual ecstasy.",

While many classical authorities aver that a strong\nlagna and lagna lord create longevity, they also suggest that for\nlongevity the lagna should not be afflicted by the lord of the eighth,\nand that ideally the lord of the lagna and the lord of the eighth\nshould be of equal strength. Although the lagna and its lord are\nvery strong in this chart, all of the lagnas are simultaneously\nafflicted by the presence of Mercury, the eighth lord.

This is one\nof the factors that contributed to Ramakrishna's relatively early\ndeath at the age of yo.\n Let us now consider, as a final contributor to the confluence of\nspiritual placements in his chart, that Ramakrishna was born in the\nsoli-lunar yoga called Siddha ('Accomplished') Yoga, which gives an\naccommodating personality, a pleasant nature and an interest in\nritual and spirituality. Although the soli-lunar Yogas are a general\ninterpretation, in Ramakrishna's chart this general interpretation\nenhances those other combinations which promised great spiritual-\nity.

By being\ninvolved in multiple yogas in Nin's chart Saturn gains the same sort\n of prominence and strength that Mercury gains in Einstein's chart.\nHere Saturn is involved in the Shasha, Sunapha, Voshi and Parvata\nYogas, and in the two important and strong Dharma Karma\nAdhipati Yogas (the combination of the lords of houses I and 5 and\n I o and 5). Mercury, who is involved in almost as many yogas in this\nchart, is less influential than Saturn because Saturn occupies his\nown rashi.\n These two grahas effectively divided Nin's life into two portions:\nsuffering (Saturn) and writing (Mercury).

'Art and psychoanalysis became her\n religion, for it gave her knowledge, which gave her control of\n her life' (Fitch, p. 6).\n 'a certain lack of skill in worldly matters, even if worldly wise' - a\n friend, while acknowledging Nin's nymphomania, said, 'I think\n of her as one of the world's great innocents' (Fitch, pp. 5-6).",

Her one\n pregnancy ended in a stillbirth.\n Nin's lagna occupied Hasta nakshatra. One of Hasta's indications\nwhich applied most emphatically to her is 'the potential for question-\nable moral orientation'. This potential was actualized because Hasta\nis afflicted (it is occupied by Mars, and Mars is conjoined with\nRahu).-The indication was reinforced by the exclusive influence of\nthe natural malefics Mars and Saturn, who also own trik houses, on\nher lagna and lagna lord respectively. Mars is the worst graha for a\nVirgo ascendant, since it is a natural malefic who owns two dusstha-\nnas, and Rahu's association worsens Mars even further. There is no\nmodification of any benefic on the ascendant, its lord, or even on\nSaturn and Mars.\n None of the three lagnas is even particularly strong here, since\nboth the Moon and Sun Lagnas are afflicted to a considerable\ndegree. Although the ascendant is afflicted by malefics, its lord does\noccupy a kona, and it participates in numerous yogas. Saturn as lord\nof the Sun Lagna also participates in several yogas, but occupies the\ntwelfth house from this lagna. The weakness of Nin's lagnas pre-\nvented her from becoming a super-renowned writer like Emily\nDickinson or Henry Miller.\n The second lord occupies the evil sixth house and is as dead as a\ndoornail, being in Mrita Avastha, since it is in the last degree of an\nodd rashi. This, combined with the malefic aspect of Saturn on the\nsecond house, prevented Nin from ever possessing the large quanti-\nties of money with which the good yogas in her chart might have\nprovided her. These factors also encouraged her tendency to tell\nlies, since the second is also the house of speech.

Jupiter, the fourth lord, is\n seriously combust, lies in a dussthana, and is hemmed by malefics\nwithout any sort of benefic influence. This constitutes a full Kuhu\nYoga, whose principal area of affliction will be the mother, since a\nwaning Moon in the fourth house will portend ominous results for\nthe mother. The fourth bhava also represents formal education and\nthe home, and the aforementioned catalog of afflictions also rendered\nthese matters problematic. Nin left high school without a diploma,\nand never really felt at home in the several countries and several\nlocales she inhabited.\n The fifth house contains its lord Saturn, who occupies Shravana\nnakshatra, which is ruled by Saraswati, the goddess of learning\nand wisdom. Shravana is strong here because its lord (Moon)\noccupies a kendra in a friend's sign with dig bala. This combina-\ntion gave her intelligence, which was further enhanced by the\nconjunction of that fifth lord with Mercury, who also occupies\nShravana. Saturn does not inhibit intelligence here because it occu-\npies its own rashi, and because it is conjoined with Mercury.\nThis combination does not bode well for children, though, since\nSaturn and Mercury are eunuchs who occupy a rashi ruled by the\neunuch Saturn.

Venus, the lord of the ninth bhava of father, occupies the\nsixth bhava in Mrita Avastha. The Sun, the significator for father,\nalso occupies the sixth, where both it and Venus are hemmed by\nSaturn and Ketu. This is a partial Nirbhagya Yoga, since the aspect\nof a malefic on the ninth bhava which would complete it is missing.\nThese afflictions to the ninth bhava account for her lack of interest\nin formal religion.\nDASHAS AND B H U K T I S Nin's father deserted the family in 1913.\nThis event would have happened either during the latter portion of\nVenus-Mars or the initial portion of Venus-Rahu.

Because\nMars and Rahu afflict one another as natural malefics, they are both\ndestined to offer bad results during the Venus Maha Dasha.\n To determine in what ninth-house matter to expect these unto-\nward results, we consider that Venus, the ninth lord, conjoins the\nSun, which is the significator for the father. When we rotate the\nbirth chart to take as the lagna the rashi in which the dasha lord sits\n(to read the results of the dasha), Venus still indicates Nin's father,\nbecause Venus rules the ninth house in that chart as well.

Nin's chart provides an excellent ex-\nample of just how valuable the system known as Shad Bala (The Six\n Strengths) can be. Shad Bala, which occupies Chapter 27 of the\nBribat Parashara Hora, is a tried and true method. In Nin's Shad\nBala, the Moon attains 9.74 r~pas(theunits used in this method),\nwhich is by far the greatest strength of any graha in her chart, the\nnext nearest being Saturn, who has 7.49 rzipas, and the weakest\nbeing Mars, who has 5.54 rtrpas. The Moon is therefore almost\ntwice as strong as several of the other grahas in the chart.\n This information still requires interpretation, for which we return\nto the Moon's traditional significations as modified by its position\nin the birth chart. The Moon, which is the natural significator of\nthe emotional mind, occupies the fourth house of emotions, and is\nbelow the horizon in a night birth chart, which creates an inner\nfocus.

It is this: 'Whoever is born in the planetary hour of Mars\nat a time when Saturn occupies in the horoscope a kendra and is\nunaspected by any benefic becomes a slave and a beggar.' You can\nexamine this for yourself, if you like. Sunrise at the birthplace on\nthat day, which was a Monday, was 7:28 a.m. If you turn to the\ntable of horas in Chapter Seven, you will clearly see that the hora of\nMars would extend from y:28 p.m. until 628 p.m. His birth took\nplace at >:48 p.m. When we now consider that all the good yogas\nhave been negated, and we factor in the Shakata Yoga, which is\ncaused by the Moon occupying a dussthana as counted from Jupiter,\nthe result is great reversals of fortune in life. Indeed, this person,\nthough born into a fabulously wealthy family, spent much of his\nadult life in poverty.\n Bhanga is an extremely important factor to consider when examin-\ning a horoscope which is filled with good yogas, for a bhanga can\nswiftly bring crashing down the fragile edifice created when interpre-\ntation of a birth chart relies too heavily on yogas. But - and this is\nan important but - simply because the yogas are broken does not\nmean that the grahas lose their power to exert any kind of effect at\nall. The grahas will continue to exert their effects, according to the\nrules of interpretation that we have been outlining, but they will do\nso only within a limited arena.

Mercury acts as a malefic here because\n it conjoins Ketu and is aspected by Saturn. This influence is\nconfirmed in its malevolence because the malefics involved are\n completely unchecked by any benefics, either by conjunction or\naspect, and is further worsened because Saturn, Mars and Sun all\nown dussthanas.

He is\nan ardent student of Jyotish and a designated Jyotish Guru at\n“Sri Jagannath Vedic Centre”.\n\nWith the Creator said to be one of its eighteen great preceptors, Jyotish or Vedic\nastrology is thought to be as old as this creation is. There are many excellent books\non Jyotish written in Sanskrit language by great Maharshis and brilliant scholars.\nThanks to the yeoman service rendered by Dr. B.V. Raman and the efforts of other\nIndian astrologers to follow him, today we have a fair amount of Jyotish literature in\nEnglish language too.\n\nConsidering the wealth of Vedic astrology literature in Sanskrit and English, another\nbook may not really be needed. Even if another book is needed, there are many\nerudite scholars who are better equipped than me to write. Nevertheless, I wanted,\nlike a parrot that enthusiastically repeats the few words learnt by it, to share with\nfellow students the little knowledge I received from classics and from my gurus.\n\nIn this book, I covered divisional charts, special ascendants, arudhas, argalas, yogas,\nashtakavarga, avasthas, a few nakshatra dasas, a few rasi dasas, several techniques\nof transit analysis, Tajaka analysis and a few miscellaneous topics.\n\nI tried to give prominence to special ascendants, divisional charts and arudhas,\nbecause contemporary literature doesn't seem to give them the kind of importance\nthat Sage Parasara gave. Understanding the primacy Parasara gave to all these\nconcepts is a must for a renaissance in Vedic astrology.",

    "output": "Unfortunately, some people think today that Parasara and Jaimini taught two totally\ndifferent approaches to astrology. When we talk about arudha padas, argalas, chara\nkarakas, chara dasa and other rasi dasas, people think of them as “Jaimini astrology”.\nPeople even use terms like “Jaimini karakas” and “Jaimini dasas”. However, all\nthese concepts were covered by Parasara also (please read “Brihat Parasara Hora\nSastram”). The “Parasari vs Jaimini” distinction is based on unfortunate\nmisconceptions that we can do away with.\n\nIn this book, I have de-emphasized these wrong distinctions and emphasized an\nintegrated approach – a holistic approach – that looks at Vedic astrology as a whole.\nI really think that this is the right approach.\n\nIn the part on dasas, I covered Vimsottari dasa and Ashtottari dasa, as they are the\nmost commonly used nakshatra dasas. Kalachakra dasa was termed the “most\nrespectable dasa” by Parasara and a discussion on dasas cannot be complete without\nit. In the galaxy of dasas, rasi dasas taught by Parasara and Jaimini have their own\nplace and I covered two rasi dasas used for timing material success – Lagna\nKendradi Rasi dasa and Sudasa. I also covered Narayana dasa, which is the most\nversatile rasi dasa taught by maharshis. For the spiritually inclined, I included\nDrigdasa, which can help us in timing events in one’s spiritual evolution. Because of\nthe importance of the topic of longevity, I covered two ayur dasas – Shoola dasa and\nNiryaana Shoola Dasa.\n\nIn the part on transits, I covered the interpretation of transits based on the natal\npositions of planets in rasi chart and divisional charts. I covered some techniques\nbased on ashtakavarga and sodhya pindas. I also covered several techniques related\nto transits in nakshatras.",

The oldest reference to these techniques to be\nfound in the works of a respected authority on Vedic astrology is in “Tajaka\nNeelakanthi”, a work by Neelakantha who also wrote a celebrated commentary on\n“Jaimini Sutras”. His coverage of Tajaka system lends some authenticity to the\nsystem. One can only speculate whether Parasara talked about this system in parts\nthat are possibly missing today. I simply followed the precedent set by illustrious\nscholars of Vedic astrology, like Neelakantha and Dr. B.V. Raman.\n\nWhen we rely on finer techniques of Vedic astrology – such as divisional charts and\nspecial lagnas – for finer predictions, it is crucial to have an accurate birthtime. The\nchapter “Impact of Birthtime Error” shows how to cope with birthtime inaccuracies.\n\nWhile I am upset with the dismissal of astrology by some critics as a ‘superstition’, I\nam equally, if not more, upset with the irrational and unscientific attitude of some\nastrologers. In an effort to promote rational thinking in the astrological community, I\nincluded a chapter on “Rational Thinking”.\n\nA very brief introduction to some special topics such as remedial measures, mundane\nastrology and muhurtas is provided in this book and it is hoped that interested\nreaders will pursue these topics further by referring to other textbooks.",

Ancient Sages laid down\nsome rules for the ethical behavior of a Vedic astrologer. I earnestly hope that all the\nreaders of this book will appreciate those rules. To that end, I added a chapter on\n“Ethical Behavior of a Jyotishi”.\n\nWhile no particular topic has been covered in great depth, most key fundamentals are\ncovered in this book.

For most part, this book is for intermediate level\nstudents who already have a good background, but are in need of integrating and\nconsolidating their knowledge. However, there are some points in some places that\ncan be appreciated only by advanced scholars. So I will not make any claims on who\nwill find this book useful. Rather than targeting readership with a specific level of\nknowledge, I tried to write a more or less self-sufficient book that covers a wide\nspectrum of topics. Beginners should read this book very carefully, and more than\nonce, to completely understand various concepts. Though I have tried to maintain\nsome level of clarity, I squeezed in a lot of material and beginners should patiently\nread, re-read and practice.\n\nDue to my background in engineering, I tried to adopt a style somewhat similar to\nthe one used in mathematics and physics textbooks. I tried to be concise and always\nto the point. I gave plenty of examples and even some exercises. I hope that students\nwill read the material and examples carefully and attempt the exercises sincerely. I\nhope that the astrological community will accept this new style of astrology teaching.",

The positions of\nSun, Moon and some planets close to earth can give important clues about the\nfortunes of individual human beings and groups of human beings. That is the basic\npremise of astrology. How exactly we can make guesses about the fortunes of\nindividual human beings and groups of human beings based on the positions of those\nplanets in the skies is the question that we will attempt to answer in this book. While\nastrology is the subject that deals with this question, there are many theories and\nphilosophies in vogue and they are significantly different from each other.\n\nSunsign astrology, for example, is based on categorizing people into 12 groups based\non the solar month of birth. Some people may be convinced, based on their\nexperiences, that people born in the same month share certain qualities. It is,\nhowever, not very logical from a rational perspective – there are just too many\npeople in this world, who are totally different from each other. So the month of one's\nbirth is totally inadequate for guessing one's nature or fortune. Even the date and the\nhour of birth are not enough.

Of course, some twins may have some\ncommon qualities between them, but the fact remains that several twins are\nsignificantly different. An astrological doctrine should be capable of explaining this\nfact in order to be considered as a meaningful subject.\n\nMost astrological doctrines of the world fail this acid test. If an astrological doctrine\nassumes, like in the case of many popular astrological theories of the world, that two\npersons born within a couple of hours in nearby towns will have the same fortune,\n\nthen that doctrine is obviously lacking in completeness and inadequate for confident\nuse in real-life. It fails the acid test of twins.\n\nMaterialistically speaking, India may not be a rich country today, but India has\nextremely rich cultural heritage. The depth of some of India's ancient knowledge\n(like astrology) is just amazing and it makes one wonder if the history of this great\ncivilization is correctly represented in the pages of modern history.

In particular, it is said to be the eye of the Vedas. So the name\n“Vedic astrology” is becoming popular these days. This author also suggests using\n“Vedic astrology” or “Jyotish” (meaning “science of light\"). Jyotishi is a practitioner\nof Jyotish, i.e. a Vedic astrologer.\n\nThe words “planet” and “star” are used in a slightly different sense in astrology than\nin astronomy. For example, Sun (a star) and Moon (a satellite of earth) are called\nplanets in astrology, along with Mars etc. Basically, a graha or a planet is a body that\nhas considerable influence on the living beings on earth. Distant stars have negligible\ninfluence on us, but Sun, Moon and planets in the solar system have a great influence\non our activities. So the word graha (or planet) is used to describe them.\n\nSeven planets are considered in Indian astrology. They are – Sun, Moon, Mars,\nMercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. In addition, two “chaayaa grahas” (shadow\nplanets) are considered in Indian astrology – Rahu and Ketu. These are also called\n“the north node” and “the south node” respectively (or the head and tail of dragon).\nRahu and Ketu are not real planets; they are just some mathematical points.\n\nApart from these 9 planets, there are 11 moving mathematical points known as\nUpagrahas (sub-planets or satellites). We also have lagna (ascendant), which is the\npoint that rises on the eastern horizon as the earth rotates around itself. In addition,\nwe have some mathematical points known as “special ascendants\".",

For the positions (calculated in degrees, minutes and\nseconds) of planets, lagna, special lagnas and upagrahas, we also use the words\nlongitude and sphuta.

These are based on dividing rasis into 2 parts, 3 parts, 4 parts and so on.\nWe divide each rasi into n parts and map each part to a rasi again. Based on the rasis\noccupied by planets in these divisional mappings, we draw divisional charts (or\nharmonic charts).

Then Sun’s\nlongitude is 23°50' + 9 x 30° = 293°50' and Moon’s longitude is 17°20' + 6x 30° =\n197°20'. The sum is 293°50' + 197°20' = 491°10'. By subtracting 360º, we get\n\n131°10'. This is equivalent to 131 x 60 + 10 = 7870'. By dividing this with 800', we\nget 9.8375. Ignoring the fraction, we get 9. Adding 1 to it, we get 10.

There are 11 karanas: (1) Bava, (2) Balava, (3)\nKaulava, (4) Taitula, (5) Garija, (6) Vanija, (7) Vishti, (8) Sakuna, (9) Chatushpada,\n(10) Naga, and, (11) Kimstughna. The first 7 karanas repeat 8 times starting from the\n2nd half of the first lunar day of a month. The last 4 karanas come just once in a\nmonth, starting from the 2nd half of the 29th lunar day and ending at the 1st half of the\nfirst lunar day.\n\nEach day starts at sunrise and ends at next day’s sunrise. This period is divided into\n24 equal parts and they are called horas. A hora is almost equal to an hour. These\nhoras are ruled by different planets. The lords of hora come in the order of\ndecreasing speed with respect to earth: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury\nand Moon. After Moon, we go back to Saturn and repeat the 7 planets.\n\nThe first hora of any day (i.e. a period of one hour following sunrise) is ruled by the\nlord of the weekday (Sun for Sunday, Moon for Monday, Mars for Tuesday,\nMercury for Wednesday, Jupiter for Thursday, Venus for Friday and Saturn for\nSaturday). After that, we list planets in the order mentioned above.",

So the 16th hour since sunrise\nwas running then. This is ruled by the 16th planet from Mercury. After subtracting\nmultiples of 7 from 16, we get 2. So the hora (hour) is ruled by the 2nd planet from\nMercury. From the list given above, we see that the 2nd planet from Mercury is\nMoon. So Moon’s hora runs at 9:40 pm.\n\nPanchaanga means “one with 5 limbs”. Almanacs published in India with planetary\npositions are traditionally called panchaangas. Along with the planetary positions,\nthey give the start and end times of tithi, vaara (week day – Sunday, Monday etc),\nnakshatra, yoga and karana running on each day.

Tropical (sayana) zodiac is\nanalogous to measuring the positions of trees and buildings sitting in a slowly\nmoving bus. Sidereal (nirayana) zodiac, on the other hand, considers a fixed zodiac.\nIt considers the motion of the tropical zodiac (bus in our analogy) and makes an\nadjustment accordingly. We use the sidereal zodiac in Vedic astrology. The\ndifference between the tropical zodiac and the sidereal zodiac is of great importance.\nWhat modern ephemeris gives us is the tropical positions of planets. To convert\nthese positions, we have to subtract the difference between the two zodiacs. This\ndifference varies with time. As earth’s precession changes every year, the difference\nbetween the tropical zodiac and the sidereal zodiac changes. This difference is called\n“ayanamsa” (sidereal difference). There are many opinions on the correct value of\nayanamsa, because nobody knows exactly which star is supposed to be the starting\npoint of the real zodiac. We will use Chitrapaksha/Lahiri ayanamsa in this book,\nwhich is accepted by most Vedic astrologers of India.\n\nDasa systems are a hallmark of Vedic astrology. Vedic astrology has hundreds of\ndasa system. Each dasa system divides one’s life into periods, sub-periods, sub-sub-\nperiods and so on. All the periods are ruled by different planets or rasis. Some dasa\nsystems are planet-based and some are rasi-based. Each dasa system is good at\nshowing events of a specific nature. For each dasa system, we have some standard",

These periods\nare called “dasas” or “mahadasas” (MD).

Some dasas are\ncomputed based on the nakshatra occupied by Moon and they are called “nakshatra\ndasas”. Some dasas are based on the rasis occupied by planets and they are called\n“rasi dasas”.\n\nWe will learn 10 different dasa systems in this book. Readers should not look at\nthese 10 dasas as ten different alternatives to look at the same life event. They should\ninstead be looked at as ways to look at 10 different aspects of the same life event. In\nfact, some of the dasas taught in this book are limited to specific matters.

Readers should patiently go through the\nmaterial in the order presented. One has to work hard on the basics. Once the basics\nare clear, Vedic astrology is a very systematic subject.",

They\nwill be defined in two groups.\n\nFive upagrahas called Dhuma, Vyatipaata, Parivesha, Indrachaapa and Upaketu\nare defined based on Sun's longitude. The exact formulas are given in Table 9. All\nthese upagrahas are very malefic in nature. Any houses occupied by them in rasi\nchart or divisional charts are spoiled by them.\n\nIt may be noted that Dhuma and Indrachaapa are apart by 180° and Vyatipaata and\nParivesha are apart by 180°.\n\nExample 6:\nLet us say Sun is at 9Sg36. Sg is the 9th rasi and so Sun's longitude can be expressed\nas 8s 9°36' (based on the notation introduced in 1.3.2). The length of each of the 8\n\nrasis before Sg is 30°.

Because Dhuma and Indrachaapa\nare 180° apart, you can say without further computation that Indrachapa is in the 7th\nsign from Ar, which is Li. His advancement from the start of Li is also 22°56'.\n\nNOTE: You can verify that Aries and Libra, Taurus and Scorpio, Gemini and\nSagittarius, Cancer and Capricorn, Leo and Aquarius, Virgo and Pisces are the signs\nthat are 180° apart. So, if Dhuma is at 11°36' from the start of Aquarius, Indrachapa\nwill be at 11°36' from the start of Leo.\n\nVyatipata is obtained by subtracting Dhuma from 360º. We see that 360º – 22°56' =\n337°4'. So Vyatipata is at 337°4', i.e. at 7°4' from the start of Pi. Since Parivesha is at\n180º from Vyatipata, he is at 7°4' in Vi.\n\nExercise 7: If Sun is at 13°19' from the start of Ta, find the positions of all the five\nupagrahas defined so far.\n\nSix upagrahas called Kaala, Mrityu, Arthaprahaara, Yamaghantaka, Gulika and\nMaandi are more difficult to compute.

So GL is at 21°47' in Virgo.\n\nExercise 8:\nA lady was born at 3:11:48 am (hr, min, sec) in the early hours of May 28, 1961. Sun\nwas at 13°1' in Taurus then. Sunrise was at 6:19:18 am on May 27, 1961 at her\nbirthplace. At that time, Sun was at 12°11' in Taurus. Find the longitudes of HL and\nGL in her chart.\n\n(1) If the birthtime changes by one minute, GL will change by 1.25° (i.e., 1°15').\n This is quite large and it can cause some error in the position of GL in some\n divisional charts. So, ghati lagna is more sensitive to birthtime errors than\n normal lagna. When using GL in divisional charts, we should keep this in mind\n and try to correct the birthtime based on known events first. Wrong data\n produces wrong results. Our analysis can only be as good as our data!",

If we prefer to choose methods that work in spite\n of deviation in birthtime by a few minutes, we are ignoring a key fact – there are\n many people in this world who are born a few minutes apart in nearby places and\n yet lead significantly different lives. Still some people hide from this fact and\n stick to methods that give the same results to everyone born in a 15-minute or\n one-hour or two-hour period, because they don't have to deal with the\n complicated issue of birthtime errors then! But that's not the right approach – we\n should give importance to finer techniques. After all, Sage Parasara must have\n written about all these fine techniques only because he thought they were useful.\n\n(3) Some people define sunrise as the time when the center of the visual disk\n representing Sun rises on the eastern horizon, i.e., the time when lagna and Sun\n are exactly at the same longitude. Some other people consider sunrise as the time\n when the upper tip of the visual disk representing Sun appears to be rising on\n the eastern horizon, i.e., the time when the first ray of Sun is seen. The latter\n approach is recommended.\n\nExercise 9:\nSuppose (just suppose) that a key event from the known past of the lady of Exercise\n8 makes us think that her GL has to be between 16°15' and 17°30' in Virgo. Correct\nthe given birthtime accordingly.\n\nUse of special lagnas will become clearer in future chapters. For now, it will suffice\nto say that hora lagna shows money and ghati lagna shows power.\n\nIn any chart, normal lagna shows self. Hora lagna shows self, from the point of view\nof money, wealth and prosperity. Ghati lagna shows self, from the point of view of\nfame, power and authority. For example, when we time good and bad periods for a\nbusinessman, hora lagna may be very important. When we time good and bad\nperiods for a politician, ghati lagna may be very important.",

Sree Lagna is important for prosperity. Its use will be shown in the chapter on\nSudasa. Computation of Sree Lagna will be explained for now.\n\n(2) Find the fraction of the constellation traversed by Moon.\n\n(4) Add this amount to the longitude of lagna. Subtract multiples of 360° if\n necessary. The resulting amount is the longitude of Sree Lagna (SL).\n\nExample 10:\nLet us take a native with Moon at 13 Li 06 and lagna at 25 Vi 05. Moon’s longitude\nis 180° + 13°6' = 193°6'. Lagna’s longitude 150°+25°5' is 175°5'.\n\n(1) Moon is in Swathi constellation, which runs from 6°40' to 20°0' in Libra.\n\n(2) Moon’s advancement in his constellation is 13°6' – 6°40' = 6°26'. As fraction of\n the whole constellation, this is (6°26')/(13°20') = 386'/800' = 0.4825.\n\n(3) The same fraction of the zodiac is 0.4825 x 360° = 173.7° = 173°42'.\n\n(4) Adding this amount to the longitude of lagna, we get 175°5' + 173°42' = 348°47.\n This is the longitude of SL. So SL is in Pisces at 18°47'.\n\nExercise 10:\nSuppose someone has Moon at 15 Le 29 and lagna at 14 Sc 19. Find the longitude of\nSL (Sree Lagna).\n\nWarning: There are some more special lagnas defined by Parasara, but they are\nbeyond the scope of this book. We will restrict ourselves to the ones defined in this\nbook.\n\n[HINT: GL with given birthtime (3:11:48 am) is at 17°48.5' in Virgo. The error is\nbetween 18.5' and 1°33.5', i.e., 0.3083° and 1.5583°. Find the corresponding error in\nbirthtime in minutes and convert it to seconds. Then subtract the error from\nbirthtime.]",

Ar may be divided into 4 parts and the 4 parts may be mapped to Ar,\nCn, Li and Cp. Then the 4 parts of Ta may be mapped to Ta, Le, Sc and Aq. And so\non. Like this, we may divide all rasis into 4 parts and map the 4 parts to different\nrasis. We may also divide rasis to 9 parts and map each part into a rasi. We can have\nmany different divisions.\n\nSage Parasara defined 16 different divisions of rasis. Jaimini and Tajaka writers\nmentioned 4 more divisions. It is possible that Parasara also dealt with these 4\nspecial divisions in sections that are perhaps missing today. In addition, there are\nmore higher and finer divisions that are normally not used.\n\nBased on the rasis occupied by planets in various divisions, “divisional charts” are\ndrawn. As we have seen before, we need to know the rasis occupied by planets,\nupagrahas, lagna and special lagnas to draw any chart. In every division, we divide\nthe rasi into different parts, find the part containing each planet and see the rasi to\nwhich that part is mapped. Then we place the planet in that rasi in the chart\ncorresponding to that division. We can draw a chart for each division. A planet can\noccupy different rasis in different divisions.\n\nChart of each division is called a divisional chart. Each divisional chart can be\ntreated as a different chart and interpreted differently. Different aspects of life are\nseen in different divisional charts. Rasi chart is simply a special case of divisional\ncharts. If we divide each rasi into just one part (i.e. in effect, no division), we get rasi\nchart.\n\nIn the rest of this book, everything we describe will be applicable to all divisional\ncharts, unless we explicitly state a chart.

If readers have an accurate software program that\n\ngives all the divisional charts for any chart, it may be acceptable to ignore the details\nof computation.

Different variations of divisional charts show different spheres of\nactivities. However, we will ignore the variations in this book.\n\nTwenty divisional charts are covered here.

The rasi containing the point of\nreference is the 1st house. The next rasi is the 2nd house. The rasi after that is the 3rd\nhouse. Suppose Moon is in Aquarius and suppose we want houses with respect to\nMoon. Then Aquarius is the 1st house, Pisces is the 2nd house, Aries is the 3rd house,\nTaurus is the 4th house and so on. As we go around the zodiac, we reach Capricorn\nwhen we find the 12th house.\n\nIn the same chart, Sun may be in Taurus. When we find houses with respect to Sun,\nTaurus contains the 1st house, Gemini contains the 2nd house, Cancer contains the 3rd\nhouse and so on. If Ghati Lagna is in Virgo in the same chart, then the 1st, 2nd and 3rd\nhouses with respect to Ghati Lagna are in Virgo, Libra and Scorpio respectively.\n\nThus we can find houses with respect to different references. The same sign may\ncontain the 2nd house with respect to one reference and the 6th house with respect to\nanother reference. If we mention houses without clearly specifying the reference\nused, it means that the reference used is lagna (ascendant). Lagna is the default\nreference when finding houses.\n\nDifferent houses stand for different matters. The matters signified by a house also\ndepend on the reference used.

All this complexity may be perplexing to new students. However, there is\nsomething we should realize. Human existence is a very complicated thing and it is\nsilly and unscientific to expect a simplistic model for the complicated human life.\nThough Vedic astrology has too many parameters used in chart analysis, they are all\nimportant as they give us the degrees of freedom necessary for modeling something\nas complicated as human life. However, if we do not understand what each\nparameter means and end up using them in a mixed-up way, we will get nowhere. So\nreaders should strive to understand these basics very clearly.\n\nLagna is the most commonly used reference when finding houses. If no reference is\nmentioned when houses are listed, it means that lagna – the default reference – was\nused. Lagna shows true self. If we are trying to understand someone’s status in\nsociety, lagna may not be the correct reference. Status does not relate to “true self”.\nIt is a part of the illusion of this world. However, if we are trying to understand\nsomeone’s intentions in doing something or someone’s knowledge or someone’s\npersistence, it relates to “true self”. So they are seen from the houses counted from\nlagna. Lagna shows true self. It shows the overall spirit of “I” (self).\n\nChandra lagna means Moon taken as a reference.

For example, someone may be working in a routine job, but he\nmay have an active and enterprising mind and he may be using it in his career. In\nthat case, the 10th house (career) from lagna may have the influence of Saturn\n\n(routine job) and the 10th house from Moon may have the influence of Mars (active\nand enterprising).",

For now, the readers should remember that arudha lagna shows how a native\nis perceived in the world. It also shows the status of a native.\n\nA planet in the 10th house from lagna may give some important developments in\none’s profession. A planet in the 10th house from Chandra lagna may give some\nimportant mental activity in one’s profession. A planet in the 10th house from arudha\nlagna may give some important developments in one’s professional status.\n\nPaaka lagna is important when analyzing the natal chart, dasas and transits.

This reference is\nimportant when analyzing one’s wealth.\n\nApart from the above references, we use several “graha lagnas” or planetary\nreferences. For each house, a planet works as the natural significator. To see matters\nsignified by a house, we can take the relevant planet as the reference. The list of\nhouses that can be seen from each planet is given in Table 12.\n\nWhen we analyze courage or persistence or weapons or younger brothers or the\nexpenditure on house or the expenditure on car, we have to analyze the 3rd house in\nthe relevant divisional chart. In all those cases, we can see the 3rd house from lagna\nand the 3rd house from Mars and draw conclusions based on the strength of both. If",

They take lagna’s longitude to be the mid-point of the first house and\nconstruct all the houses accordingly. In the “equal house method”, they take a 30º arc\nwith center at lagna as the 1st house.

The rasi containing the reference point\nchosen is the 1st house and the next rasi is the 2nd house.\n\nThough there are some indirect references in BPHS19 suggesting that Parasara\nsupported house divisions placing houses in 2 rasis, there are quite a few direct\nreferences making it amply clear that each house falls in one rasi.

Natural malefics in the 3rd and 6th houses from AL show someone who\nis perceived as a bold person who hits enemies hard. Since such impressions are\nusually formed about materially successful people, malefics in the 3rd and 6th from\nAL make one bold and materially successful. Natural benefics in the 3rd and 6th\nhouses from AL make one very gentle and restrained in public behavior. Such a\nperson does not fight with others boldly.

It deals more with one’s\nstatus in career.\n\nArudha padas show the maya (illusion) of material world. Arudha pada of nth house\nshows the maya associated with the matters signified by of nth house.\n\nFor example, 1st house stands for self. While the first house from lagna stands for\ntrue self, its arudha pada (AL) stands for the maya associated with self. It shows the\nhow the native is perceived in the material world. It shows the status of the native.\n\nThe 4th house in D-16 shows happiness from vehicle. It shows true happiness from a\nvehicle.\n\nOne may be very happy with a Bajaj Chetak (an inexpensive two-wheel vehicle\npopular in India) or even a bicycle and one owning three Mercedes Benz cars may be\nunhappy with them and always dreaming of owning a better vehicle. One’s true\nhappiness from vehicle has nothing to do with the type of vehicle owned. However,\npeople perceive one with 3 Mercedes Benz cars as a happier person in the matter of\nvehicle, compared to a Chetak owner. This is the maya associated with “happiness\nfrom vehicle” in this material world. So this is shown by A4.",

It aspects all the fixed signs except the one\nadjacent to it, i.e. Ta. So Ar aspects Le, Sc and Aq.\n\nTa is a fixed sign. It aspects all the movable signs except the one adjacent to it, i.e.\nAr. So Ta aspects Cn, Li and Cp.\n\nGe is a dual sign. It aspects all other dual signs. So Ge aspects Vi, Sg and Pi.\n\nIt may be noted that sign Y will aspect sign X if sign X aspects sign Y. A visual\nrepresentation of rasi aspects is given in Figure 2. A line is drawn between every pair\nof signs that aspect each other. A planet aspects the signs aspected by the sign it\noccupies. It also aspects the houses and planets in those signs. This aspect is called\n\nrasi drishti (sign aspect). For example, a planet in Libra will aspect the houses and\nplanets in Aq, Ta and Le.\n\nExercise 15: Find the rasis, houses and planets aspected with rasi drishti by Sun,\nMoon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu in Chart 5.",

    "output": "A simple analogy will make things clearer. Look at planets as people. Let us take a\npriest as an example. Will he have some influence on his neighbors? Probably.\nBecause he lives there, gets up early in the morning and recites mantras, it may\ninfluence his neighbors also. Because of the houses they live in, his neighbors come\nunder his influence. How pious and god-fearing his influence makes his neighbors\ndepends on other factors. If one of the neighbors is a dreaded criminal, he is not\ngoing to be influenced.\n\nLet us take a dreaded criminal as another example. He may also have an influence on\nhis neighbors. Youngsters living in the neighboring houses may enter the criminal\nworld because of him. Ladies in the neighboring houses may stay inside their houses\nat night and not come out after certain time.\n\nThus we are influenced by people in neighboring houses. Influence exerted by\nplanets by rasi drishti is similar to this influence.\n\nCompared to this limited influence on the neighbors, a priest may have greater\ninfluence in the matters of the nearby temple where he works. He may have a lot of\ninfluence on devotees who come to visit the temple and who approach him for\nperforming poojas, homas etc. Influence exerted with graha drishti is similar to this\ninfluence.\n\nInfluence exerted by rasi drishti is due to the sign a planet is in. This is analogous to\nthe influence people exert on their neighbors. All planets in a sign will have rasi\ndrishti on the same signs, just as people living in the same house see the same\nneighbors everyday and exert some influence over the same neighbors. But the\ninfluence they exert may differ. A priest may tell his neighbors to pray to God. His\nmovie-loving brother living in the same house may talk the same neighbors into\n\nwatching all the movies of a particular actress. Thus, planets in the same sign exert\ninfluence on the same houses and planets through rasi drishti, but the nature of the\ninfluence varies from planet to planet.",

    "output": "Influence exerted by graha drishti is due to the inherent nature of a planet. Different\nplanets in the same sign may aspect different houses and planets with graha drishti.\nA priest may have great influence over the devotees at the temple he works at and his\nmovie-loving brother living in the same house may have great influence over his\nmovie-loving classmates and co-members of the fan club of an actress, of which he\nis president. Similarly, planets in the same sign may influence planets in different\nhouses. However, everyone in a house may have a strong influence over friends of\nthe family who visit the house frequently. Similarly, all planets aspect the 7th house\nfrom them and have an influence over it.\n\nIn addition to the influence caused by planets with graha drishti and rasi drishti, there\nis another influence called “argala”.\n\nArgala is a very important concept in Vedic astrology. Literally speaking, argala\nmeans “a bolt”. Argala on a house shows the influences that intervene in its affairs,\ndecide some parts of it and close the bolt on it, so to speak. Planet having rasi drishti\nhave a small influence. Planets having graha drishti have a more concrete influence.\nPlanets with argala simply decide some parts of the matter signified by the house.\nThe influence caused by argala is decisive.\n\nA planet or house in the 2nd, 4th and 11th houses from a planet or house causes\nprimary argala on the latter. Argala by a benefic planet is called a “subhaargala”\n(benefic intervention) and argala by a malefic planet is called a “paapaargala”\n(malefic intervention). This simple concept can be better appreciated if some\nexamples are given.",

One’s intelligence (5th), interaction with others (7th) and\nand overall character and samskara (2nd) make or break one education. If Jupiter is in\n5th house, he will give intelligence and his subhargala (benefic intervention) on 4th\nwill help one’s education. If Rahu is in 5th house, his papargala (malefic\n\nintervention) on 4th will cause obstacles in one’s education by way of poor\nintelligence. Similarly, benefics and malefics in the houses causing argala cause\ngood and bad intervention. Basically, the point is that intelligence, interaction and\nsamskara are the things that decide one’s education. They have a decisive role.\n\nLet us take another example. Short journeys are seen from the 3rd house. What are\nthe things necessary for a journey? One needs a vehicle (4th). One may need\nsomeone to serve one by driving the vehicle. Servants are seen from 6th. So, no\nwonder the 4th and 6th houses cause argala on the 3rd house, being the 2nd and 4th\nfrom it respectively! If one has papargala on 3rd from 4th, it may show trouble to the\njourney because of the vehicle. If one has papargala on 3rd from 6th, it may show\ntrouble to the journey because of the driver.\n\nLet us take another example. Domestic harmony, comfort, well-being and happiness\nare seen from the 4th house. What are the things that can make or break domestic\nharmony? Of course, wife, children and other family members! Each of them can\nintervene in one’s domestic harmony. No wonder the 5th, 7th and 2nd houses have an\nargala on the 4th house (being the 2nd, 4th and 11th respectively from the 4th house)! If\na malefic in 5th has papargala on 4th, it may show domestic clashes and lack of sukha\n(comfort/happiness) on account of a child. If a benefic in 7th has subhargala on on\n4th, it may show domestic happiness due to a caring partner.",

Hard work is another decider.\nIn the case of journey, argala of 7th house on 3rd house (7th is the 5th from 3rd) shows\nthe influence of partners in a journey.\n\nVirodhargala shows the obstruction of argala. Planets and houses in the 12th, 10th, 3rd\nand 9th houses from a house or planet cause virodhargala and obstruct the argala on it\nfrom the 2nd, 4th, 11th and 5th houses from it (respectively). For example, let us say\nMercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn are in Ge, Pi, Ar and Vi respectively. Saturn is in\nthe 4th from Mercury and Ge and he causes argala on them. With Saturn being a\nmalefic, this is a paapaargala (malefic intervention). But Jupiter is in the 10th from\nMercury and Ge. So he obstructs Saturn’s argala and averts the troubles. Venus is in\n\nthe 11th from Mercury and Ge and so he causes argala on them. With Venus being a\nbenefic, it is a subhaargala (benefic intervention). If Le (3rd from Ge) is empty, this\nargala is unobstructed.\n\nNOTE: If a sign contains Ketu, argalas and virodhargalas on it are counted anti-\nzodiacally. For example, let us say Ketu is in Vi. Then Le, Ge, Sc and Ta are the 2nd,\n4th, 11th and 5th from Vi (counted anti-zodiacally) and planets in those signs cause\nargala on Vi and on the planets in Vi.

Many yogas are applicable in\ndivisional charts. When we use yogas in divisional charts, we should interpret the\nresults ascribed to a yoga based on the matters signified by the divisional chart.\n\nA few key yogas will be listed in this chapter, but the reader is urged to do more\nreading.

They make one the best in something.\n\nBasic Raaja Yoga: In any chart, Lord Vishnu sits in the quadrants and Goddess\nLakshmi sits in the trines. If the lord of a quadrant is associated with the lord of a\n\ntrine, that association brings the combined blessings of Lakshmi and Vishnu. This is\ncalled a Raaja Yoga. The native is powerful and prosperous.\n\nWhat do we mean by “association” here? There are 3 important associations:\n\n(1) The two planets are conjoined,\n(2) The two planets aspect each other with graha drishti, or,\n(3) The two planets have a parivartana (exchange). For example, if the 4th lord is in\n the 5th house and the 5th lord is in the 4th house, then we say that there is a\n parivartana between the 4th and 5th lords. This is an association.\n\nIf the lord of a quadrant and the lord of a trine have one of the three kinds of\nassociations mentioned above, it forms a Raaja Yoga. Lagna can be taken as a\nquadrant or a trine here. It is both.\n\nDharma-Karmadhipati Yoga: This is a special case of the above yoga. If the lords\nof dharma sthana (9th) and karma sthana (10th) form a raja yoga, it is known by this\nspecial name. The 9th house is the most important trine and the 10th house is the most\nimportant quadrant. Raja yoga involving the lords of these two houses is excellent.\nOne born with this yoga is sincere, devoted and righteous. He is fortunate and.\n\nVipareeta Raaja Yoga: The 6th, 8th and 12th houses are known as trik sthanas or\ndusthanas (bad houses). If their lords occupies dusthanas or conjoin dusthanas, it\nresults in this yoga. One having this yoga experiences tremedous success, typically\nafter an initial struggle. Vipareeta means extreme.\n\nBecause dusthanas show the obstacles one faces in life, situation of dusthana lords in\ndusthanas shows that obstacles will run into obstacles themselves.

But the results of this yoga may be experienced with just one or two dusthana\nlords occupying a dusthana.\n\nWe find the conjunction of the lords of a quadrant and a trine in many charts. The\nmagnitude to which this raaja yoga fructifies depends on the strength of the two\nplanets. The key factors that come into play are:\n\n(1) The two planets should be free from afflictions from functional malefics.\n\n(2) The conjunction or aspect responsible for the Raaja Yoga should be close (say,\n within 6° or so).\n\n If Mercury and Venus are at 2° and 26° in Ta for a native with Cp lagna, for\n example, their conjunction brings a Raaja Yoga (Dharma-Karmadhipati Yoga in\n particular).

If Venus\n is at 3° in Ta in instead of 26°, the conjunction is very close and the yoga can\n give its full results, if other factors are favorable.\n\n(3) The two planets should not be combust, debilitated or in an inimical house or in\n bad avasthas (states).\n\nAny blemishes here will considerably reduce the magnitude of the yoga.

Count the divisional charts –\nout of the ten charts of Dasa Varga scheme – in which a planet occupies an own,\nexaltation or moolatrikona sign. Based on the count of divisional charts with such a\ngood placement for the planet in question, we say that it is in a particular amsa.\nPlease see the chapter “Divisional Charts” for details.\n\nIf the two planets giving raaja yoga have a count of one or zero, the yoga is ordinary\nand gives good results depending on the factors already outlined.",

In addition, the planets in the 2nd house and the strength of 2nd lord matter.\n\nA lot of combinations and results have been given in this chapter. Readers are\nadvised to read more literature and practice yogas on real charts. One should be able\nto find with a quick glance the yogas present in a chart. Experience certainly helps\nthere. In the rest of this book, we will see some examples of yogas.\n\nWhen looking at the results ascribed to various yogas, try to fit them in today’s\nworld. For example, one with Kamala yoga may not really become a king, but\nprobably become the Prime Minister of a nation or the Governor of a state. When\nusing yogas in divisional charts, adapt the results to the matters signified by the\nchart.\n\nAll the great results ascribed to some yogas may not materialize in reality, due to\nweaknesses in them. Unless a yoga is very strong, all the results cannot expected.\nJust one yoga cannot make or break a personality, unless it is very powerful.\n\nIn the case of yogas with many conditions, partial results may sometimes be\nexperienced if all the conditions are not satisfied.",

Sage Parasara said that it is\ndifficult for even great Maharshis. In Kali Yuga41, human beings become sinful and\nthe sins kill their intelligence. Parasara said that the intellectual pygmies of Kali\nYuga cannot cope with too many complicated principles and presented ashtakavarga\nas a simple technique that lets them make reasonable predictions without much fuss.\nAshtaka means “consisting of eight” and varga means “a group”. Ashtakavarga is the\nsystem of analyzing a chart with respect to a group of 8 reference points.\n\nWhen we analyze the positions of planets with respect to lagna, we have the concept\nof good and bad placements. For example, Jupiter in the 9th from lagna will be well\nplaced and Jupiter in the 3rd will be badly placed. Mars in the 3rd from lagna will be\nwell placed and Mars in the 9th will be badly placed.\n\nHowever, lagna is not the only reference point in a chart. We have Sun and Moon. In\nfact, all the planets serve as reference points in a chart and they represent the sources\nof various energies that are present in a native. Based on the houses in which\ndifferent planets are placed in transit, they can be benefic with respect to some\nenergy sources and malefic with respect to some. If a transiting planet is benefic with\nrespect to more energy sources, then it brings good results.\n\nSo ashtakavarga is essentially a system that tells us the benefic positions of lagna and\nseven planets with respect to each other. This can be used to analyze the strength of a\nnatal chart, but it is much more important in analyzing transits.",

To\nunderstand how to read this table, let us go to the column titled “Merc” in Table 19.\nThis shows benefic houses for Sun to occupy, with respect to Mercury. The 1st and\n2nd houses have 0 and the 3rd house has 1. So the first 2 houses from Mercury are\nmalefic for Sun and the 3rd house is benefic for Sun.

In other words, Mercury is benefic in Ar with\nrespect to 7 references. So we write 7 in Ar. We see that Mercury is benefic in Ta\nwith respect to Sun, Mercury, Venus and Saturn. In other words, Mercury is benefic\nin Ta with respect to 4 references. So we write 4 in Ta. We find the count of\nreferences for each rasi and prepare a chart.

People got the classics by heart and recited them to their children and\nstudents. Books were written in poetry, using nice meters, to facilitate memorization.\n\n(3) Venus’s ashtakavarga: As per Parasara, Venus is benefic in the 4th from Mars and\n malefic in the 5th from Mars. As per Varahamihira, Venus is malefic in the 4th\n from Mars and benefic in the 5th from Mars.\n\nThe definitions and calculations given in this chapter strictly follow Parasara for the\nreasons already mentioned. However, readers are welcome to experiment and draw\ntheir own conclusions. Until authentic and conclusive researches are conducted into\nthe use of sodhya pindas in the timing of events, we cannot conclusively resolve the\nabove controversy.\n\nApart from this, there is another needless controversy related to ashtakavarga. Some\npeople prepare “bhava chakra” or “chalit chakra” using Sripathi’s (or Porphyry’s)\nhouse devision method and use that chart to cast ashtakavarga. If Saturn is at 3º in Vi\nand lagna is at 27º in Le, they are very close and these people argue that Saturn is in\nthe 1st house from lagna and not in the 2nd house. These people make a bhava chakra\naccordingly and use it in ashtakavarga. However, if lagna is at 15º in Le, Saturn is at\n3º in Vi and Jupiter is at 27º in Le, they may take Saturn to be in the 2nd house from\nJupiter. They compute a bhava chakra with multi-sign houses only with respect to\nlagna and not with respect to all the references used in ashtakavarga. So their\napproach is neither here nor there.",

    "output": "The stand of this book is very clear – each bhava (house) with respect to one\nreference can only be in one rasi. Even if Saturn is at 1º in Vi and lagna is at 29º in\nLe, we still say that the 1st house is in Le, the 2nd house is in Li and Saturn is in the\n2nd house (though he is only 2º away from lagna). We do not recognize the house\ndivision methods of Porphyry and others in this book. Each rasi is a house and the 1st\nhouse is the rasi containing the reference. Readers will do well to follow Maharshi\nParasara and ignore the creations and borrowings of later day Indian astrologers.\n\nSee Table 22 for Mercury’s ashtakavarga. Looking at the columns of different\nplanets, find the houses from the planets in which Mercury is benefic. Count those\nhouses from the respective planets and find the rasis.\n\nUsing the above values, one can prepare a chart for each planet’s BAV, as shown in\nChart 11.\n\nUsing the above values, one can prepare a chart for SAV, as shown in Chart 11.\n\nLagna is in Vi in Chart 12. Vi it has 39 rekhas. That’s a lot more than 30! The 10th\nhouse (Ge) also has more than 30 rekhas. So this D-10 is very powerful and it\n\npossibly cannot belong to an unsuccessful waiter at a small restaurant. This has to be\nsomeone pretty successful.\n\nApart from the 1st and 10th houses, the 2nd house is strong in D-10’s SAV, with 33\nrekhas. This shows the importance of speech and voice in her career. Ghati lagna is\nin Taurus and its lord Venus occupies it. This makes ghati lagna and 9th house very\npowerful. This shows a fortunate (9th) and famous (GL) entertainer (Venus). Saturn’s\n11th house argala on GL suggests popular mass support as a catalyst in her success.\nRahu’s unobstructed 2nd house argala on lagna shows unconventional behavior in\npublic life.47\n\nFinal Answer: The chart belongs to Madonna, a pop diva of USA.",

    "output": "In the case of planets owning two rasis, we need to judiciously combine the two\nindications. The list of yogakarakas, functional benefics, functional neutrals and\nfunctional malefics for each lagna is given in Table 30. Moon is not listed for\nmovable rasis, because his functional nature depends on whether he is waxing or\nwaning. Waxing Moon is a natural benefic and he becomes a functional malefic with\n\nquadrant ownership. Waning Moon, on the other hand, is a natural malefic and\nquadrant ownership makes him functionally neutral.\n\nA functional benefic is a favorable planet in a chart. Placement of a functional\nbenefic in quadrants (sustenance) and trines (prosperity) brings good results.\nPlacement of a functional malefic in these houses is not good, unless it is very\nstrong. A functional malefic placed in the 3rd house and dusthanas (6th, 8th and 12th\nhouses) brings good results, by spoiling the significations of the bad houses.\n\nIf a planet aspects or conjoins or owns HL and lagna, it becomes a yogada (giver of\nyoga) in money matters. If a planet aspects or conjoins or owns GL and lagna, it\n\nbecomes a yogada in the matters of power and authority. Irrespective of their\nfunctional nature, planets that become yogada bring goodluck. Similarly, planets\ninvolved in important yogas also bring good luck.\n\nWe should consider the inherent nature and the functional nature of planets. Whether\na planet is a natural benefic or a natural malefic is analogous to whether a person is\ninherently good or bad. Whether a planet is a functional benefic or a functional\nmalefic is analogous to whether a person does good or bad to one. Just as a nice\nperson may harm one and a bad person may do good, natural benefics can become\nfunctional malefics and natural malefics can become functional benefics.",

    "output": "For a house falling in a movable/fixed/dual rasi, the 11th/9th/7th house (respectively)\nfrom there becomes baadhaka sthaana (troubling spot). Its lord is called a\n“baadhaka” (troublemaker) for the original house. The list of baadhaka sthaanas and\nbaadhakas corresponding to each rasi is given in Table 31.\n\nFor example, suppose lagna in someone’s D-10 is in Ge. Then Jupiter is baadhaka\nfor lagna. The periods of Jupiter and planets in Sg can create some obstructions and\ntroubles in career. Let us take another house. Aq is the 9th house and the 9th house in\nD-10 shows the guidance one gets in one’s career. It can show manager and elders\ngiving guidance. Baadhaka sthana for Aq is Li. So the periods of Venus and\noccupants of Li can create some troubles related to the guidance one gets. There may\nbe some troubles related to manager. Thus we can consider baadhaka from every\nhouse and arudha pada in every divisional chart.\n\nWhen we analyze the charts, we should remember all the concepts we learnt in the\nprevious chapters. The following factors must be remembered:\n\n(1) Divisional Chart: Use the correct divisional chart for the matter of interest.\n Suppose we are looking at happiness from a vehicle. D-16 is the best chart.\n Suppose we are trying to analyze a criminal’s psychology. D-30 is the best chart.\n Suppose we are analyzing marriage. D-9 is the best chart. Suppose we are\n analyzing marriage in a culture where marriage is not a dharma (duty) and a\n union of souls, but it is merely living together of two people, then rasi chart may\n be better than D-9. Suppose we want to study one’s religious activities. Then D-\n 20 is the chart. If we want to study one’s learning, D-24 is the chart. Suppose we\n want to study one’s career and achievements in society, D-10 chart is the correct\n chart. In this manner, we should choose the correct divisional chart.",

    "output": "(2) House: We should choose the correct house after choosing the correct divisional\n chart. Let us say that we are analyzing someone’s learning related activities and\n decided to look at D-24. If we want to see his education, we see the 4th house. If\n we want to see his intelligence, scholarship, academic reputation, academic\n distinctions/awards, students etc, we should look at the 5th house. If we want to\n see how one, in one’s pursuit of knowledge, interacts with others and what kind\n of people one interacts with, then we should see the 7th house. Like that, we\n choose the correct house for the matter of interest.\n\n(3) Reference: We should choose the correct reference for counting houses. In the\n above example of D-24, academic reputation is related more to the perceived self\n (AL) than the true self (lagna). So it is seen from the 5th from arudha lagna (AL).\n Intelligence and scholarship, on the other hand, are related to the true self and\n\n they are seen from the 5th from lagna. When the relevant karakas are stronger, we\n can use them as references instead of lagna. So scholarship can be seen from the\n 5th from Mercury. Students can be seen from the 5th lord. Intelligence can be seen\n from the 5th from Jupiter. Academic reputation can be seen in D-24 from the 5th\n from Sun.\n\n(4) House vs Arudha: Sometimes, an arudha pada is more appropriate to see a\n matter than a house. For example, we can see darapada (A7) in D-24 to figure out\n what kind of people one typically interacts with in one’s learning related\n activities. We can see one’s academic distinctions/awards in A5, because they are\n maya (illusion) related to intelligence and scholarship. The world forms an\n impression about one’s intelligence and scholarship based on one’s scores, ranks,\n grades, distinctions and awards.",

    "output": "(5) Influences: After we choose a house/arudha in a divisional chart to represent the\n matter of interest, the next step is to analyze the influences on it. Planets\n influence it with rasi drishti and graha drishti. We should also check for argala.\n We should judge the meaning of each influence. We can also judge the\n influences on a house by finding houses with respect to that house. Planets in the\n quadrants from a house sustain it. Planets in trines from a house let it prosper.\n Planets in upachayas let it grow. Planets in dusthanas bring obstacles. Suppose\n we are analyzing A3 in an author’s D-10. While the 3rd house shows one’s\n writing skills, it is A3 that shows one’s books. If a planet is in a quadrant from\n A3, its periods may result in book writing. If a planet is in the 8th house from A3,\n its periods may bring obstacles in book writing. If a planet is a baadhaka from\n A3, it can create troubles in book-writing.\n\n(6) Standard Results: There are many standard results given in literature for various\n planets and house lords in various houses. These results should be mastered.\n\nAttention should be paid to the strength and avasthas of various planets and\nashtakavarga strength of various houses. The presence of yogas should also be noted.\n\nWe can analyze the fortunes of family members from one’s chart. For parents,\ngrandparents, uncles and aunts, we should see D-12. For children, children-in-law\nand grandchildren, we should see D-7. For brothers, sisters, brothers-in-law and\n\nsister-in-law, we should see D-3. For spouse and his/her family members, we should\nsee D-9.\n\nIn each of these charts, we should look at the house that shows the person of interest\nand consider the rasi containing the lord of that house as lagna. We can consider the\ncorresponding arudha pada also. For example, the 9th lord or the arudha pada of 9th\nhouse in D-12 shows father. The 4th lord or the arudha pada of 4th house in D-12\nshows mother.",

Suppose lagna is in Le, Saturn is in Sg and\nMars is in Ge. Then Saturn is a maraka on account of owning the 7th house (Aq).\nMars is a malefic and he is in Ge. He aspects the 2nd house (Vi, with the 4th house\naspect) and the 7th lord (Saturn in Sg – with the 7th house aspect). Because of these\ntwo factors, Mars is a maraka. Let us take another example. Suppose lagna is in Pi,\nMars is in Ge, Mercury is in Cp and Saturn is in Ar. On account of owning the 2nd\nand 7th houses, Mars and Mercury are marakas. Look at Saturn. He is in the 2nd\nhouse and aspects the 2nd lord Mars (with the 3rd house aspect) and the 7th lord\nMercury (with the 10th house aspect). So Saturn is also a maraka and he may in fact\nbe a stronger maraka than Mars and Mercury.\n\nWhen we time one’s death using a dasa, we should look for the involvement of\nmaraka sthanas and maraka grahas. We can also use marakas when timing death\nusing the transits of planets.\n\nIn Indian mythology, there are eleven Rudras. They are all different forms of Lord\nShiva. They bring suffering and death to a native. Trishoola or trident is the weapon\nof Lord Shiva. Maheswara is the Supreme form of Lord Shiva and he gives\nemancipation to the soul.\n\nFor every person, there are eleven rasis that represent the eleven Rudras. These rasis\nbring suffering related to various areas of life.\n\nOut of all the eleven Rudras, the one who brings suffering to the physical self is the\nmost important one. In each chart, there is one planet that plays this role. That planet\nis simply called “Rudra”. That planet stands for the suffering and destruction of the\n\nnative. There are three rasis designated as Trishoola rasis and they bring death. Let\nus see the astrological defintions.",

If both planets conjoin the same\nnumber of planets, a planet in exaltation or own rasi is stronger. A planet joining\nexalted planets is stronger. A planet aspected by many planets (rasi aspect) is\nstronger. Finally, a planet which is more advanced in its rasi is stronger. We find the\nstronger planet in this manner and it becomes Rudra. However, if the weaker planet\nis debilitated or in an inimical sign and conjoined/aspected by malefics like Mars,\nSaturn, Rahu and Ketu, then it becomes Rudra.\n\nThe three trines from the rasi occupied by Rudra in rasi chart represent the three\nspikes of Shiva’s Trishoola/trident. They are called Trishoola rasis. Depending on\nwhether a native has short life or middle life or long life, one of the three Trishoola\nrasis kills the native during its Shoola dasa.\n\nThe lord of the 8th house from AK (chara atma karaka) is called Maheswara.

However, if Moon is in lagna or the 7th house, then the\nsecond pair of Moon and Saturn should be given preference.\n\nExample 47: Let us say that lagna is in Ta, HL is in Ar, Moon is in Ta, Mercury is in\nCn, Venus is in Cp, and Saturn is in Ge.\n\nPair 1: Lagna lord Venus is in Cp, a movable rasi. The 8th house is in Ge (see Table\n32) and Mercury owns it. He is in Cn, another movable rasi. Looking for the\ncombination “Movable + Movable” in the table, we see that “long life” is the result.\n\nPair 2: Moon is in Ta, a fixed rasi. Saturn is in Ge, a dual rasi. Looking for the\ncombination “Fixed + Dual” in the table, we see that “long life” is the result.\n\nPair 3: Lagna in Ta, a fixed rasi. Horalagna is in Ar, a movable rasi. Looking for the\ncombination “Movable + Fixed” in the table, we see that “middle life” is the result.\n\nWe see that two pairs indicate long life and one pair indicates middle life.

For example, when finding the arudha pada of a house falling in\nScorpio, we learnt that we have to take the stronger of Mars and Ketu as the lord of\nScorpio. In several rasi dasas, dasas start from the stronger of lagna and the 7th\nhouse. We need to be able to compare them and judge which is stronger. A house\nmay be influenced by several planets and they may suggest contradictory results.

So M = 25. The native was\nborn at 5:50 pm and sunrise was at 6 am. So 11:50 hours passed since sunrise. In\nminutes, this is 710 minutes. Because a ghati contains 24 minutes, this is 29.6 ghatis.\nSo the 30th ghati after sunrise was running at birth. So G = 30. Lagna is in Virgo, the\n\n6th rasi from Aries and so L = 6. The native’s given name starts with “V” and the\nnumber corresponding to this sound is 1.\n\nMercury: Mercury is at 3Ar08. He is in Aswini, i.e. 1st constellation. So C = 1.\nBecause Mercury is the 4th planet from Sun, P = 4. Mercury is in the first 1/9th of Ar\nand so A = 1. Using the formula, we get (C x P x A) + M + G + L = (1 x 4 x 1) + 25 +\n30 + 6 = 65. Dividing it by 12, we get a remainder of 5. From Table 36, we see that\nan avastha index of 5 means “Gamana” avastha (going/on the move). We see that 5 x\n5 is 25. Adding 1 (corresponding to the sound), we get 26. Remainder when this is\ndivided by 12 is 2. Adding 3 (Mercury’s planetary adjustment), we get 5. When we\ndivide it by 3, remainder is 2. It shows “Cheshta”. So Mercury’s results due to\n“Gamana” avastha are given in full. We see that the standard results are “visits the\ncourts of kings frequently, wealthy”.",

Rasi dasas are\n based on rasis occupied by planets and dasas are owned\n by rasis in rasi dasas.\n\n(2) Phalita dasas and Ayur dasas: Phalita means results and\n ayur means longevity. Phalita dasas are used for general\n results and ayur dasas are used for predicting death.\n\nHundreds of dasa systems were enumerated by the seers of\nVedic astrologey. Specific uses of these dasa systems weren’t\nclearly mentioned in classics. These are hidden in remote\ncorners of India as family secrets.",

    "output": "In this part, the use of the following dasa systems is explained\nin detail:\n\nSudarsana Chakra dasa is one of the most important dasas\nmentioned by Parasara. However, for reasons that will become\nclear later, we will learn it in the part “Tajaka Analysis”.\n\nVimsottari dasa is the most popular dasa system among Vedic astrologers of today.\nSage Parasara mentions in “Brihat Parasara Hora Sastram” that this dasa system is\nthe most suitable dasa system in Kali yuga.\n\nVimsottari means 120. Vimsottari dasa is a dasa system where the total duration of\nthe dasa cycle is 120 years. Dasas of different planets are for different number of\nyears, but the sum of all dasas is 120 years.\n\nIn Kali yuga, paramaayush (maximum longevity) of human beings is supposed to be\n120 years. Consequently, Vimsottari dasa is the most suitable dasa in Kali yuga.\n\nDasas are reckoned here based on the constellation occupied by Moon. There are\nother variations that are more applicable in some cases. Many contemporary Vedic\nastrologers ignore these variations and always reckon dasas from the lord of the\nconstellation occupied by Moon. However, this may not result in the best predictions\nalways. In this book, we will look at some of the variations.\n\nOne’s life is divided into dasas – periods – ruled by the nine planets. A dasa is also\ncalled a “mahadasa” (mahadasa = master period). Each mahadasa is again divided\ninto 9 sub-periods ruled by 9 planets. These sub-periods in mahadasas are called\n“antardasas”. We can divide further. Sub-periods in antardasas are called\n“pratyantardasas”. Sub-periods in pratyantardasas are called “sookshma-antardasas”\nor simply sookshma dasas. Sub-periods in sookshma dasas are called “prana-\nantardasas” or simply prana dasas. Sub-periods in prana dasas are called “deha-\nantardasas”. In this book, we will denote mahadasa with MD, antardasa with AD,\npratyantardasa with PD, sookshma dasa with SD, prana-antardasa with PAD and\ndeha-antardasa with DAD.",

    "output": "The lengths of the dasas (periods) of various planets are given in Table 38. The order\nof dasas is also as indicated in that table. For example, let us say that the first dasa is\nSun’s. It will be of 6 years. Then 10 years of Moon dasa will follow. Then 7 years of\nMars dasa will follow. And so on. At the end of the table, we come back to the first\nentry. For example, let us say that the first dasa is of Jupiter. Then the order of dasas\nwill be Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun (go back), Moon, Mars and Rahu.\n\nIn this manner, we can find the order of dasas and dasa lengths, given the first dasa.\n\nFor computing Vimsottari dasa, use the following steps:\n\n(2) Find the advancement of Moon in the constellation.\n\n(3) Find the part of the constellation that is yet to be traversed by Moon, as a fraction\n of the length of the constellation. [NOTE: Length of each constellation is 13°20'.]\n\n(4) First dasa will belong to the lord of the constellation.\n\n(5) Find the sequence of dasas and dasa lengths from Table 38.\n\n(6) Multiply the length of the first dasa by the fraction found in step (3). Only this\n amount in the first dasa is left at birth. The rest was over before birth.\n\nControversy: Dasa length of each planet was given in years in Table 38. For\nexample, Sun dasa is for 6 years. However, what is the meaning of “a year” here? Do\nwe mean the normal solar year, i.e. 365.2425 days? Or, do we mean a savana year of\n360 days that is used when finding the running year for calculating varsha bala (year\nstrength) in shadbalas? Or, do we mean a period in which Moon traverses through\n360 constellations? Or, do we mean a period of 360 tithis (luni-solar days)? Most\nscholars, including this author’s guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, use solar years. However, this\nauthor prefers savana years based on the teachings of his father. Savana years will be\nused with nakshatra dasas in all the calculations given in this book. This is not meant\nto be a recommendation.",

Dhanishtha\n constellation starts at 23°20' in Cp and ends at 6°40' in Aq.\n(2) Moon’s advancement in Dhanishtha = 2Aq23 – 23Cp20 = 32°23' – 23°20' = 9°3'.\n(3) The total length of the constellation is 13°20'. The length yet to be traversed in\n this constellation as a fraction of the total constellation length = (13°20' –\n 9°3')/13°20' = 4°17'/13°20' = (4x60+17)/(13x60+20) = 257/800 = 0.32125.

Similarly, we can find the start and end\ndates of all dasas.\n\nEach mahadasa is divided into 9 antardasas.

So antardasa order in Venus dasa is — Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Rahu,\nJupiter, Saturn, Mercury and Ketu. Length of Venus antardasa is 20/120 of the total\ndasa length, i.e. 20x20/120 years = 3 years and 4 months. Length of Sun antardasa is\n6/120 of the total dasa length, i.e. 20x6/120 years = 1 year. Length of Moon\nantardasa is 10/120 of the total dasa length, i.e. 20x10/120 years = 1 year and 8\nmonths. Length of Mars antardasa is 7/120 of the total dasa length, i.e. 20x7/120\nyears = 1 year and 2 months. In this manner, we proportionally divide the period of a\nmahadasa into 9 antardasas.\n\nWe use the same procedure to divide each antardasa into 9 pratyantardasas, each\npratyantardasa into 9 sookshma dasas and so on.\n\nIn the case of the first dasa, we don’t divide the remainder at birth (2.24875 years of\nMars dasa remainder, for example, in Example 50) into 9 antardasas. Instead, we\ndivide the complete duration of the first dasa (7 years of Mars dasa, for example, in\nExample 50) into 9 antardasas.

If\nthe reader does not have any software and needs to compute dasas by hand, he or she\nshould practice with many charts.\n\nWe always compute the fraction left at birth in the first dasa based on the fraction of\nthe constellation occupied by Moon, that is yet to be traversed by Moon. However,\nwe need not always take the lord of Moon’s constellation as the planet ruling the first\ndasa. We can take the lord of the 4th, 5th or 8th constellation from Moon’s\nconstellation to start the first dasa. These 3 stars are called kshema, utpanna and\nadhana stars.",

He passed away on 20th December 1998, leaving a void in the astrological\ncommunity.\n\nAs per Vimsottari dasa reckoned from Moon’s star, he passed away in Venus-Sun\nantardasa. Venus is a maraka being in the 7th house, but he is not a very strong\n\nmaraka. Though Sun owns 7th, he is in 6th, i.e. in the 12th from 7th and the 11th from\n8th. The likelihood of Sun killing the native is small.\n\nWho are the strongest marakas in this chart? Certainly, Mercury is the strongest\nmaraka. He owns 8th and occupies 7th. Malefics in the 2nd house are strong marakas.\nSo Rahu in the 2nd is also a maraka. Mars is also a maraka, being the 3rd lord in 7th.\n\nLet us consider the variations of Vimsottari dasa based on 4th and 8th stars. The 4th\nstar is Pushyami in Cancer. The 8th star is Uttaraphalguni and its 1st quarter is in Leo.\nBecause Leo is the strongest sign, we can start dasas from Sun who owns\nUttaraphalguni (8th star from Moon’s star).\n\nStarting Vimsottari dasa from the 8th star, we can see that Mercury-Rahu antardasa\nwas running in December 1998. Killership of both the planets has already been\naddressed.\n\nIn this chapter, Vimsottari dasa and its variations are explained and their use is\ndemonstrated. Use of Vimsottari dasa as a phalita dasa as well as an ayur dasa is\ndemonstrated. As this is the most common constellation-based dasa system, readers\nshould master its use through practical experience.\n\nThough many people limit themselves to Vimsottari dasa started from the birthstar,\none is advised to use the variations mentioned in this chapter for the best results.\n\nIf all the quadrants from the stronger of lagna and Moon are occupied by planets,\n“Kendradi Graha Dasa” is more appropriate than Vimsottari dasa. Results from\nVimsottari dasa may not be very good in such cases.",

So an error of 5 minutes\nin the birthtime results in an error of 5x20/4 = 25 days in dasas (this is approximate).\nConsidering this, we cannot use low level sub-periods of Vimsottari dasa (like\nsookshma dasas) confidently, unless we rectify the birthtime.\n\nIt is a good idea to allow a margin of error when we examine the dates on which\ndasas start and end.\n\nAshtottari dasa is perhaps the most popular dasa system in India after Vimsottari\ndasa. Sage Parasara listed it as a conditional dasa applicable only in some charts. The\nconditions for its applicability are highly controversial.\n\nIn this system, the sum of all dasas is 108 years. Ashtottari means “ashtottara sata”,\ni.e. one hundred and eight. Because poornaayush (full life) of a man is 108 years,\nsome scholars have suggested that ashtottari dasa is best used as an ayur dasa, i.e. a\ndasa that shows longevity.\n\nSome other scholars suggest that Ashtottari dasa can be used as a phalita dasa.\nBecause only chara karakas, i.e. Rahu and the seven planets, have dasas under the\nAshtottari dasa scheme, it may also be suggested that it shows events related to\nsustenance, achievements, raja yogas and moksha (just like chara karakas do). Some\npeople, however, prefer to see all matters in Ashtottari dasa.\n\nOrder of dasas and the length of dasas is as shown in Table 39. Each planet covers an\narc of either 53°20' (4 nakshatras) or 40°0' (3 nakshatras) in the zodiac, as shown in\nthat table.",

The fraction of the arc that is yet to be\ntraversed by natal Moon is calculated and the same fraction of the dasa length of the\nfirst dasa lord is left at birth. After that, dasas will come in the order shown in the\ntable and the length of a planet’s dasa is the full dasa length given in the table. After\nVenus, we come back to Sun at the beginning of the table.\n\nExample 59: Suppose Moon is at 24° in Leo. That is equivalent to 24°0' + 120°0' =\n144°0'. We see that 144° is between 120°0' and 160°0'. So it is in the 2nd arc of Table\n39, which is ruled by Moon. The full dasa length is 15 years. Here we have to find\nthe fraction of the arc that is yet to be traversed. The arc starts at 120°0' and ends at\n160°0'. So the part of the arc that is yet to be traversed by Moon is (160°0' – 144°0')\n\n= 16°. As a fraction of the arc length (40°), this is 16°/40° = 0.4. The same fraction\nof the full dasa length of Moon is 15 x 0.4 = 6 years. The native will run Moon dasa\nof 6 years from his birth. Then 8 years of Mars dasa will run. Then 17 years of\nMercury dasa will run. Then 10 years of Saturn dasa will run. And so on.\n\nNOTE: One has to be careful with the calculation if the first dasa is Rahu dasa. The\narc ruled by Rahu starts at 333°20' and ends at 26°40'. The ending longitude 26°40' is\nequivalent to 386°40' and we should use either 26°40' or 386°40' based on Moon’s\nlongitude. For example, if Moon is at 10º in Aries, then the part of the arc that is yet\nto be traversed is 26°40' – 10° = 16°40'. If Moon is at 20º in Pisces, i.e. at 350º, then\nthe part of the arc that is yet to be traversed is 386°40' – 350° = 36°40'.",

Antardasas in Moon dasa go as: Mars, Mercury, Saturn,\nJupiter, Rahu, Venus, Sun and Moon.\n\nThe length of a dasa is divided into eight antardasas in the ratio of the dasa lengths.\nFor example, Sun dasa is of 6 years.

Of course, this\napplies to everything taught in this book, but it is especially applicable to this\nchapter.\n\nNarayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita dasa. It shows general\nresults. Narayana dasa is computed differently for different divisional charts and we\ncan use Narayana dasa of a divisional chart to predict matters related to that\ndivisional chart.\n\nNarayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one’s life. As one dasa ends\nand another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and another rasi\nbecomes one’s progressed lagna. Using the progressed lagna as the reference, we\nfind out the events that happen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each\nperson, with each chart applicable in one dasa.\n\nThis is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould pay attention to the details of\ncalculation.\n\nDasas start from lagna or the 7th house, whichever is stronger. We use the rules of\nstrength explained in the chapter “Strength of Planets and Rasis”. Let us denote the\nstronger of lagna and 7th house by the expression “dasa seed”.",

Venus is in Le, i.e. the 4th house from Ta in the forward direction.\nSo dasa length is 4–1=3 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1960 to Aug 1963.\n\nLi is an odd-footed sign. So we count houses from Li to its lord Venus in the forward\ndirection. Venus is in Le, i.e. the 11th house from Li in the forward direction. So dasa\nlength is 11–1=10 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1963 to Aug 1973.\n\nPi is an even-footed sign. So we count houses from Pi to its lord Jupiter in the\nbackward direction. Jupiter is in Sc, i.e. the 5th house from Pi in the backward\ndirection. So dasa length is 5–1=4 years. This dasa runs from Aug 1973 to Aug 1977.\n\nThus the first cycle of dasas ends in Aug 1977. The second cycle starts then. Dasas\nwill come in the same order as in the first cycle. Let us compute the second cycle.\n\nBecause Le dasa is of 1 year in the 1st cycle, it is 12–1=11 years in the 2nd cycle. This\ndasa runs from Aug 1977 to Aug 1988.\n\nBecause Cp dasa is of 8 years in the 1st cycle, it is 12–8=4 years in the 2nd cycle. This\ndasa runs from Aug 1988 to Aug 1992.\n\nBecause Ge dasa is of 2 years in the 1st cycle, it is 12–2=10 years in the 2nd cycle.\nThis dasa runs from Aug 1992 to Aug 2002.",

Aq is stronger\nthan Le.)\n\nEach dasa is divided into 12 antardasas. All the antardasas have an equal length. If a\ndasa is of n years, then each antardasa in that dasa is for n months.\n\nAntardasas start from the rasi containing the lord of dasa rasi or the rasi containing\nthe lord of the 7th house from dasa rasi. Let us denote the stronger of dasa rasi and\nthe 7th from it with the expression “antardasa seed”. Antardasas start from the rasi\ncontaining the lord of antardasa seed and we take the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc houses from\nthere. The direction of counting houses is forward or backward based on whether the\nrasi from which antardasas start is an odd rasi or even rasi. (NOTE: We are talking\nabout odd and even signs here and not about odd-footed and even-footed signs).\n\nExample 67: Suppose Cp dasa of 5 years is running. Lords of Cp and Cn are Saturn\nand Moon respectively. Suppose Saturn is in Le and Moon is in Ta. Antardasas start\nfrom either Le or Ta. If Cp is stronger than Cn (or Saturn is much stronger than\nMoon), then we start from Le. If Cn is stronger than Cp (or Moon is much stronger\nthan Saturn), then we start from Ta. Let us say Cn is stronger than Cp and Saturn is\nnot much stronger than Moon. Then antardasas start from Ta, which contains Moon.\nBecause Ta is an even sign, counting is backward. So antardasas go as — Ta, Ar, Pi,\nAq, Cp, Sg, Sc, Li, Vi, Le, Cn and Ge. Each antardasa is of 5 months.\n\nExceptions: If Saturn occupies antardasa seed rasi, antardasas go in the forward\ndirection. If Ketu occupies antardasa seed rasi, antardasa direction is reversed (from\nforward to backward or from backward to forward). In the above example, antardasa\nsequence becomes Ta, Ge, Cn, Le, Vi, Li, Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq and Pi, if Ketu occupies\nCn.",

Why did Ta antardasa bring an\naccident?\n\nTa is the 12th from vahanapada (A4 – arudha pada of the 4th house). It can give losses\nto the vehicle. Lord of A4 is Mercury and he is with Rahu and Ketu in Ta. So vehicle\ncan be involved in an accident. Moreover, mrityu pada (A8) is in Ta and troubles\n\nrelated to vehicles can be expected. Nobody was hurt in the accident, but the car was\nbadly damaged and the native was given a new car by his insurance company. In the\nnext 6 months, his new car was damaged twice while parked in a parking lot. One of\nthe damages was serious. So Ta antardasa continued to give vehicular troubles.",

    "output": "One may wonder why we are looking at antardasa and not mahadasa. Events shown\nby mahadasa suggest the overall mood of the whole 10 year period, while events\nshown by antardasa are applicable to 10 months here. With Li being the 4th house\nand having the argala of lord Venus, the native had the comfort of vehicles in Li\ndasa. However, Ta antardasa was bad due to Rahu and A8. Based on the event of\ninterest, we should judiciously choose mahadasa or antardasa or pratyantardasa for\nexamination. If an event plays a role in a native’s life for just a week, it is probably\nshown in pratyantardasa. If an event plays a role in a native’s life for a few months, it\nis probably shown in antardasa. Mahadasa shows the mood of longer periods. If we\nwant to analyze a temporary activity that remains in a native’s mind for just an hour,\nit is probably seen in the praana-antardasa or deha-antardasa running then. We\nshould determine the effective period of an event and judiciously choose the dasa\ndivision in which it should be seen.\n\nNarayana dasa is a versatile rasi dasa. It is a general purpose phalita dasa. It can be\ncomputed separately for each divisional chart for precise timing of events related to\nthe matters associated with that divisional chart. We can go down to the precision of\na day or an hour by using fine sub-divisions of dasas. As in Example 71, we can\ndivide each antardasa into 12 equal pratyantardasas. This is done in the same manner\nas each dasa is divided into 12 equal antardasas. In the same manner, we can divide\neach pratyantardasa into 12 equal sookshma-antardasas (or simply sookshma dasas),\neach sookshma-antardasa into 12 equal praana-antardasas (or simply praana dasas)\nand each praana-antardasa into 12 equal deha-antardasas.",

The\nnext question is — how do we measure the length of a sub-period? In days, hours,\nminutes and seconds? No! We measure the length of a period (or a sub-period) by\nthe angle of the arc traversed by Sun during that period (or sub-period). Two periods\nare said to be equal if and only if Sun moves by the same degrees, minutes and\n\nseconds during the two periods. In other words, we take 1 year=12 months and 1\nmonth=30 days, where 1 day is the time in which Sun moves by 1º.\n\nMotion of Sun is the basis for measuring time in rasi dasas. Suppose a dasa of 5\nyears starts after the native completes 37 years. If Sun is at 23° 50' 25'' in Aq in the\nbirthchart of a native born in 1960, he finishes 37 years when Sun reaches the same\nlongitude in 1997. If the dasa is of 5 years, each antardasa is of 5 months. This\ncorresponds to the time in which Sun moves by 5x30º=150º. When each antardasa\ndivided into 12 equal pratyantardasas, Sun moves by exactly 150º/12=12°30' during\neach pratyantardasa.",

Its versatility lies\nin the fact that it can be computed separately for each divisional chart for precise\ntiming of specific matters. In fact, we can compute more than one Narayana dasa for\neach divisional chart. Narayana dasa of D-12 seeded from the 12th lord is native-\ncentric. It shows events in a native’s life that are related to parents. Even when\nlooking at the events in the lives of parents, it takes the native as the reference. To\nsee events in the lives of parents directly, we can use different seeds. Similarly, 12th\nhouse used as the seed in D-24 Narayana dasa shows the learning from the point of\nview of one’s evolution. One can use the 4th house (formal learning) as the seed in\nD-24 Narayana dasa to see formal education. By using a different seed, we can\nexamine the events related to the chosen divisional chart from a different angle.\nReaders should try to master this fantastic dasa system.\n\nThe 7th house has 2 planets and lagna has only one. So the 7th house acts as dasa\nseed. Progression for Aq is: every 6th. Because Li (9th from Aq) is odd-footed,\ndirection is normally “forward”.

This\nprogression is seen for dual signs in Narayana dasa. On the other hand, if we cover\nthe quadrants of lagna first, then go to the quadrants of 5th/9th and finally cover the\nquadrants of the 3rd trine, then the sequence is trine-based and Sri Lakshmi rules it.\n\nIn other words, the sequence 1st, 5th, 9th, 10th etc is quadrant-based and it is ruled by\nNarayana.

It can\nalso be a rasi that aspects the rasi that, in navamsa, contains the owner of the 8th\nhouse from dasa rasi. Suppose dasa rasi at death is Ta and Jupiter is in Le in\nnavamsa. Then the antardasas of the 6th, 7th, 8th and 12th houses from Ta (i.e. Li, Sc,\nSg and Ar) can bring death. Also the antardasas of Ar, Le, Li and Cp – rasis that\naspect Le, which contains Jupiter in navamsa – can bring death. If there is a common\nrasi between these two principles, it can be a strong candidate.\n\nExample 84: Let us consider the native of Chart 8. Rudra, Trishoola etc were found\nfor this native in Exercise 23. Let us calculate Niryaana Shoola dasa.\n\nWe have to find the stronger of 2nd (Sg) and 8th (Ge). Sg is stronger.

Niryaana Shoola\ndasa starts from the stronger of Ta and Sc. Sc is stronger as it has one planet.

Niryaana Shoola dasa starts from the 8th house from one of them.\nNiryaana Shoola dasa essentially shows the progress of the 8th house. It shows the\nmotion of praana (life). That is why it has an uneven motion. It goes forward in some\ncharts and backward in some charts. Also the lengths of dasas can be 7, 8 or 9 years.\nAll this shows that different people have different motion of praana. When praana\nreaches Shiva’s Trishoola or a powerful maraka rasi, the native can die. In Shoola\ndasa, however, the motion has a constant rate of 9 years per dasa and the order of\ndasas is always fixed. This fixed motion is like the motion of a quartz crystal. It is\nnot the motion of praana and it must be a universal motion. It is suggested that\nShoola dasas show the force of Lord Shiva. The force of Lord Shiva starts from\none’s self and moves at a constant rate in a fixed direction. So Shoola dasa rasi\nhitting Trishoola rasis is less significant than Niryaana Shoola dasa rasi hitting\nTrishoola rasis.

Death occurs when\npraana hits maraka rasis and the trines from Rudra (Trishoola rasis). Shoola dasa is\nthe reverse. It shows the motion of Shiva.

Dara Shoola dasa (dara = wife) starts from the stronger of 7th and 1st\nhouses and it shows the death of wife (this dasa will be identical to the native’s\nnormal Shoola dasa). Putra Shoola dasa (putra = son) starts from the stronger of 5th\nand 11th houses and it shows the death of a child.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that sthira karakas are useful in timing death. Sthira karaka of\nfather represents father in a chart, for the purpose of matters controlled by Shiva (i.e.\nsuffering and death). Pitri Shoola dasa shows the motion of Shiva’s force for the\nfather. When Shiva’s force strikes trines from sthira karaka of father, father’s death\ncan take place. Trines from the corresponding arudha pada can also give death.\n\nSimilarly, we can time the death of other near relatives. Let us see a couple of\nexamples.\n\nExample 93: Let us consider the native of Chart 44. His father passed away in the\nsecond half of 1995.\n\nExalted Sun joins Mercury and Jupiter aspects him. So Sun is stronger than Venus.\nHe becomes sthira pitri karaka (fixed significator of father). Death can occur in trines\nfrom him, i.e. Ar, Le and Sg. Pitri pada (A9, arudha pada of 9th house) is in Sg.\nTrines from it are the same.\n\nThe 9th house is in Aq. Among Aq and Le, Aq is stronger as its lord Rahu is in a rasi\nwith a different oddity. Dasas go as Aq, Pi, Ar etc.",

Kalachakra literally means “the wheel of Time”. It\nshows how the wheel of time unfolds events in the life of an individual.

Savya means “zodiacal” and apasavya means\n“anti-zodiacal”.\n\nWe write the 12 rasis in one set (either zodiacally or anti-zodiacally).

So Sc dasa was running at birth and 7 – 2.25 = 4.75 years of Sc dasa\nwere remaining at birth. By adding 4 years 9 months to the birthdate, we get the date\non which Sc dasa ends.

In the case of antardasas, the starting point is based on\ndasa rasi.\n\nTo learn how the lengths of antardasas are computed, let us take Le dasa as an\nexample.

So Le is a markati\n gati rasi. Similarly, when we go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Le, Cn, Vi, Li, Sc etc in apasavya\n nakshatras, we temporarily reverse the direction when we go from Le to Cn. So\n Cn is a markati gati rasi.\n\n(3) Leaving one rasi and jumping over it is called “Mandooki gati” (frog’s leap).\n When we go as Sc, Li, Vi, Cn, Le, Ge, Ta, Ar etc in savya nakshatras, we have 2\n jumps – (i) from Vi to Cn and (ii) Le to Ge. So Cn and Ge are mandooki gati\n rasis. Similarly, when we go as Ar, Ta, Ge, Le, Cn, Vi, Li, Sc etc in apasavya\n nakshatras, we have 2 jumps – (i) from Ge to Le and (ii) Cn to Vi. So Le and Vi\n are mandooki gati rasis.\n\n67 Simhavalokana doesn’t really mean a lion. It strictly means a lion’s view of the jungle from an\nelevated vantage point.\n\nThe results attributed to various leaps are given in Table 51.\n\nIn addition, Parasara listed the directions to prefer and the directions avoid, while\ntravelling and relocating, during different leaps.\n\n(1) In the leap from Vi to Cn, east will give great results. One can take up an\n auspicious journey in the northern direction.\n\n(2) In the leap from Le to Ge, east should be avoided. A journey to the southwest\n will be fruitful.\n\n(3) In the leap from Cn to Le, a move in the southern direction results in losses.\n West is favorable.",

At the time of wedding, the native was\nrunning Pi-Pi (Pi dasa & Pi antardasa). Why did Pisces give marriage?\n\nWell, it has lagna in navamsa and its lord Jupiter is in the 7th house! Naturally Pi and\nVi are the front-runners for giving marriage. Moreover, Pi is the 2nd from Venus.\nVenus symbolizes domestic happiness and marital bliss. The 2nd from him in\nnavamsa can show the sense of family happiness. It can show a new person coming\ninto the family.\n\nIn addition, one may note that exalted Venus occupies Pi in rasi chart and he owns\ndarapada, which is in Libra. So Pisces is conducive to physical relationship and\nmarital pleasures.\n\nVenus is in Aq in navamsa. While rasi shows what exists at the physical level,\nnavamsa shows the inner self and the sense of connectedness. So Aq dasa can\nactivate Venusian influence at navamsa level and give some romance. During Aq\ndasa (1990-1994), this native had a love affair with the lady he was to marry in\nDecember 1994.\n\nExample 99: The D-24 shown in Chart 47 belongs to an astrologer. He learnt\nastrology at a young age, but he has been seriously into astrology since 1993. In\nparticular, 1996-2000 was a very fruitful period. Knowledge came to him like rain\nfrom monsoon clouds.

This is D-24\nand lagna in it shows all-round progress related to learning and knowledge. Its lord\nMercury is in the 5th house of scholarship from lagna. So this dasa can increase\nscholarship. Mercury and Venus are in trines from Ge and they contribute to the\nprosperity of the indications of Ge. Moreover, Ge is very strong in D-24 with 34\nrekhas in SAV. Any rasi 30 or more rekhas brings favorable results related to that\nhouse in that divisional chart.\n\nThe strongest houses in this D-24 SAV are Le (36 rekhas), Ge (34 rekhas) and Pi (33\nrekhas).

So we can use the 9th lord or A9 to see the\nphysical body of father. Here A9 is in Cp. Taking Cp as lagna, we see that Cn is the\n7th house of death and its lord Moon is exalted. Moon is not only exalted, but he\nafflicts Sun, who owns the 8th house from Cp. So Cn-Cn antardasa can result in the\ndeath of father. Moreover, Cn dasa here comes after Vi and involves mandooki gati\n(frog’s leap).

This book follows the\napproach that this author found the most acceptable based on his study of “Brihat\nParasara Hora Sastram” and his practical researches. A significant percentage of this\nauthor’s successful long-range life-phase predictions were made using Kalachakra\ndasa68 and that is his favorite dasa.\n\n68 And, a significant percentage his successful short-term predictions (focussing on a period of one or\ntwo weeks) were made using Tajaka annual and monthly charts.\n\nWhen we learn a new dasa, the first question we should ask is “when should it be\napplied and what results should be seen in it”. It is illogical to use 10 different dasas\ninterchangably. Mixing up various dasas without knowing the subtle differences\nbetween them results in vague explanations. An intelligent astrologer will realize that\ndifferent dasas are good at showing different kinds of events. Even when different\ndasas show the same event, they show it from different angles and focus on\ndifferent aspects of the same event. Without appreciating this, one cannot\nunderstand why maharshis described tens, if not hundreds, of dasa systems.\n\nHence it is important to learn when a dasa can be applied and what kind of results it\nshows. Some authors suggested that Kalachakra dasa applies only when Moon is\nstronger in navamsa chart than in rasi chart. However, this author opines that\nKalachakra dasa is applicable to all people, as Parasara did not impose any\nconditions on its applicability and went to the extent of calling it “the most\nrespectable dasa”.",

Of course, one’s mental\nstate directly depends on the direction taken by one’s life and the real happenings in\none’s life. In that sense, Vimsottari dasa and Narayana dasa show the same events.\nBut the focus is different.\n\nKalachakra dasa depends on Moon’s navamsa. Navamsa shows one’s adherence of\ndharma or duty and throws light on the inner self. So the focus in Kalachakra dasa is\nstate of the inner self and the sense of connectedness in one’s mind. It shows how\nconnected one is with respect to the events in one’s life. For example, a political\nleader may be running D-10 Narayana dasa of a yogakaraka rasi and he may land\npolitical power. He may be running the Vimsottari dasa of Sun who may be exalted\nin D-10 and so he may be feeling powerful. However, if Kalachakra dasa of a weak\nand afflicted house in D-10 runs at the same time, his inner self may not feel\nconnected with the events in his career and he may feel a void. On the other hand, if\nKalachakra dasa rasi is strong and occupied by benefics in D-10, then one may be\nsuccessfully involved in activities that keep his inner self engaged.\n\nNarayana dasa specializes in showing what happens in one’s life; Vimsottari dasa\nspecializes in showing how one’s mind views what happens in one’s life; and,\nKalachakra dasa specializes in showing how one relates to what happens in one’s\nlife and how connected one feels. These three are the most important of all general\npurpose phalita dasas.\n\nDifferent dasas do not provide different alternatives that can be used interchangeably\nto understand what happens in one’s life, but they provide different angles – or\nvantage points – to view the same kaleidoscope that life is.",

Lagna is the hub of\nvitality and one’s personality in a chart. Using the ashtakavarga tables, we can\ndecipher whether the transit of a planet in a house from lagna is favorable or not. We\ncan see which house a planet is transiting in, with respect to natal lagna, and expect\nthe planet to influence the matters of that house. The influence exerted by a transit\nplanet on the house occupied by it depends on its inherent nature and its\nsignifications in the natal chart. For example, Jupiter transiting in the Ta may give\nmarriage to someone born in Sc lagna, because Ta is the 7th house from Sc.

We can\nlook at the aspects cast by transiting planets on the rasis containing the natal houses\nand the natal planets. Suppose someone has lagna in Sc and Venus in Pi in natal\nchart. Then the 7th house is in Ta and Venus, the significator of marriage, is in Pi.\nJupiter transiting in Vi aspects both Ta and Pi and hence he may give marriage.\n\nThus we should look at the rasis occupied and aspected by planets in their transit and\nfind out which houses and planets occupy those rasis in the natal chart. Based on\nthat, we should guess the results given by the planets. A planet occupying or\naspecting a rasi in transit influences the matters signified by the houses and\nplanets stationed in that rasi in the natal chart. The exact nature of the influence\nexerted by a planet depends on its inherent nature and the matters it stands for in the\nnatal chart.

If\nMars is the 8th lord in the natal chart and aspects, in transit, the rasis occupied by\nVenus and 7th lord in the natal chart, then some disturbances in marital life may be\nexpected.\n\nSahams are useful in transit analysis.

If Jupiter has 8 rekhas in Ar in natal D-10 chart,\nthen his transit in Aries in rasi chart invariably brings excellent results in career. The\nmatters that benefit depend on Jupiter’s placement and ownership in the natal D-10\nchart. Basically, Jupiter’s rasi transit in Aries activates the manifestation of Jovian\nenergy at the physical level in Aries. If Jupiter has many rekhas in his D-10 BAV, it\nshows that Jovian energy in Aries goes well with most sources of energy in D-10 and\nthus it can have a significant impact on a native’s career.\n\nA planet with 6 or 7 rekhas in its transit rasi in its BAV invariably brings excellent\nresults. A planet with 1 or 0 rekhas in its transit rasi in its BAV invariably brings\nvery poor results.\n\nIn addition to looking at the transit planet’s natal BAV, we should also look at the\nnatal SAV – Samudaaya Ashtakavarga.

Multiplying 86 with 5, we get 430. If we divide 430 by 27, the quotient is 15 and\nthe remainder is 25. The 25th constellation is Poorvabhadrapada. So Saturn’s transit\nin Poorvabhadrapada is bad for father and Jupiter’s transit in the same nakshatra is\ngood. Now let us find the rasi. By dividing 430 by 12, we get a quotient of 35 and a\nremainder of 10. So Saturn’s transit in Cp (the 10th rasi of the zodiac) is bad for\nfather and Jupiter’s transit in Cp is good.",

A\nlist of the matters is given in Table 61.\n\nSome examples will be given now. However, this approach does not give consistent\nresults. Readers should realize that the topic of sodhya pindas is open to research.\nMost astrologers use these principles with only the rasi chart. If matters relating to\nfather have to be seen from D-12, as taught by Parasara, should we use D-12 when\ntiming events related to father? Should we use the sodhya pinda and rekha count\nfrom D-12? Should we take the 9th from Sun in rasi chart or take it in D-12? All\nthese are issues that need to be researched. Moreover, as we have learnt, there are\nsome inconsistencies between Parasara and Varahamihira in the definition of\nashtakavarga and this can alter the sodhya pindas of Moon and Venus. In addition,\n\nwe have some controversies in the exact definitions of the reductions to be done to\nget Sodhita Ashtakavarga from Bhinna Ashtakavarga. That can again alter sodhya\npindas. Timing of events with sodhya pindas is a very important topic, but what the\nreaders learn here may not be the final word. It is hoped that readers will experiment\nwith an open mind and share their findings with other astrologers.\n\nExample 111: Let us consider Princess Diana, who died in a fatal automobile crash\nwhen Saturn was in Revathi star (Pisces). Her rasi chart is given in Chart 62.\n\nTo see longevity, we should use the 8th house from Saturn and Saturn’s BAV. The 8th\nhouse from Saturn is Le.\n\nLe has 0 rekhas in Saturn’s BAV. Saturn’s sodhya pinda is 203. The product is 0. By\ndividing it with 27, we get 0 which is equivalent to 27. So we get Revathi star. By\ndividing 0 with 12, we get 0 which is equivalent to 12. So we get Pisces.\n\nWhen Saturn was transiting in Revathi star in Pisces, she passed away.",

Suppose\nsomeone has natal Moon in Pisces (e.g. Bill Gates, whose chart was considered\nearlier). Aquarius is the 12th house from Pisces. So Mercury is a loha murthi (iron\nform) during his Ge transit. That is highly unfavorable. Even if it is a favorable\ntransit otherwise, Mercury may not give his full results. If it is an unfavorable transit\notherwise, then Mercury will make the native suffer much.\n\nWe listed the good and bad houses for all planets to transit from natal Moon in a\nprevious chapter. Even when a planet is transiting in a favorable house from natal\nMoon, it may be “obstructed” by another planet transiting in the vedha sthana (house\nof obstruction). In that case, the planet cannot give its good results. The vedha\nsthaanas of all good transits of all planets are listed in Table 63.\n\nLet us take Bill Gates, who has natal Moon in Pisces. Natal lagna and arudha lagna\nlord Mercury transits in Gemini during June 2000. As Mercury transiting in the 4th\nhouse from natal Moon is auspicious, this transit should bring good results.

Find if any planets had latta on janma nakshatra or lagna nakshatra at the\ntime of the ruling. Find the common house related to those planets in the natal chart.\n\nDefinition: Sarvatah means “everywhere” or “entirely”. Bhadra means “auspicious”\nor “well”. Sarvatobhadra chakra is a chart that shows all-round well-being and all\nkinds of auspicious and inauspicious results.\n\nThere are 9 x 9 = 81 squares in the chart. Middle 7 squares on the outer borders\ncontains 7 nakshatras each. Abhijit (the last quarter of Uttarashadha) is included\namong the nakshatras. The innermost 5 squares contains weekdays and tithis (lunar\ndays). The notation regarding tithis is:\n\n(1) The entry Nanda represents 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st and 26th tithis.\n(2) The entry Bhadra represents 2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd and 27th tithis.\n(3) The entry Jaya represents 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd and 28th tithis.\n(4) The entry Rikta represents 4th, 9th, 14th, 19th, 24th and 29th tithis.\n(5) The entry Poorna represents 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th and 30th tithis.\n\nRasis are also included in the chart. Some consonants are listed in the squres just\ninside the border squares. All the squares lying on diagonals of the chart, except the\ncentral square of the chart, contain vowels. There are 16 vowels and 20 consonants\nthat are covered. We see that 16 (vowels) + 20 (consonants) + 12 (rasis) + 28\n(nakshtras) + 5 (tithis and weekdays) = 81.\n\nVedha: When a planet occupies a nakshatra, it causes vedha (obstruction) on the\ncontents of the squares along 3 lines. We can draw one vertical or horizontal line and\ntwo crossward lines starting at the nakshatra. Contents of the squares on the lines\nhave vedha from the planet.\n\nExample 114: Let us say Saturn is in Punarvasu. We see that Punarvasu is on the\neastern border.",

    "output": "Readers should refer to the first chapter for the procedure of finding tithis. Karma\ntithi is a little different from normal tithi. To find karma tithi, we multiply the\ndifference between Moon’s longitude and Sun’s longitude with 10 and reduce the\nproduct to a value between 0º and 360º (by adding or subtracting multiples of 360º).\nWe divide it by 12 and add 1 to the quotient. That gives a number between 1 and 30\nand that represents “karma tithi”. Karma tithi changes 10 times as fast as normal\ntithi. Similarly “dhana tithi” (lunar day of wealth) changes twice as fast as normal\ntithi. We can find a tithi for several matters. The tithi relevant to the matter of\ninterest should be used when finding vedha of transiting planets on tithis (Nanda,\nBhadra, Jaya, Rikta and Poorna).\n\nLet us take an example. If the 10th house, karma nakshatra, karma tithi and janma\nvaara all have the vedha of a couple of transiting benefics, then some good\ndevelopments may take place in the native’s career. If they have the vedha of a\ncouple of malefics (instead of benefics), then we can expect setbacks in the native’s\ncareer. In this manner, we study the impact of transits on important tithis, janma\nvaara, important nakshatras and important houses in natal chart. If just one natal\nreference has vedha from just one planet, we cannot make any predictions. But, if 2-\n3 natal reference have vedha from a couple of benefic/malefic transit planets, then\nwe can be more confident. However, a prediction should be made only if dasas and\nTajaka charts also show an event.\n\nExample 115: Let us consider the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. The data of birth\nand death can be found in Example 107.",

Naidhana nakshatra (constellation of death) is in Bharani. If all these\nnatal reference points have vedha from a couple of natural malefics, then death is\nmore likely on other days. Of course, one will not die whenever this happens, but\nthis will increase the chances of death.\n\nIn the transit chart, Saturn is in naidhana nakshatra Bharani. Mars is in Swati. Rahu\nis in Asresha. Ketu is in Sravanam.\n\nIf we draw crossward lines from Ketu in Sravanam and Saturn in Bharani, we can\nsee that they intersect in the square containing Jaya and Thursday. So janma tithi\n(Jaya) and janma vaara (Thursday) have vedha from Ketu and Saturn. Janma\nnakshatra Dhanishtha has vedha from Ketu in Sravanam and Rahu in Asresha.\nVainaasika nakshatra Anooradha also comes under the vedha of Saturn in Bharani\nand Rahu in Asresha. The house of accidents Cp, which is the 3rd house from AL in\nnatal chart, comes under vedha from Ketu in Sravanam and Mars in Swati.\n\nConsidering that several key natal references are coming under the vedha of a couple\nof malefics, unfavorable results are possible.

    "output": "A sub-system of Indian astrology, popularly known as “Tajaka\nsystem”, is extremely useful in making precise and pointed\npredictions. It considers planetary aspects and yogas different\nfrom those employed in other classical methods of Vedic\nastrology and it is closer to western astrology in terms of\naspects and yogas. In fact, some scholars may validly question\nwhy Tajaka system is being covered in a book on Vedic\nastrology. There are no references to it in the works of Parasara,\nJaimini and other maharshis. The oldest reference to these\ntechniques to be found in the works of a respected authority on\nVedic astrology is in “Tajaka Neelakanthi”, a work by\nNeelakantha who wrote a celebrated commentary on “Jaimini\nSutras”. His coverage of Tajaka system lends some authenticity\nto the system. One can only speculate whether Parasara talked\nabout this system in parts that are possibly missing today. We\nwill cover this system in this book, because some illustrious\nscholars of Vedic astrology, like Neelakantha and Dr. B.V.\nRaman, set the precedent by teaching this system.\n\nThis system is based on solar return charts. When Sun returns\nevery year to the position he occupied in the zodiac at the time\nof a person’s birth, a new year is said to commence for the\nperson and a chart drawn for that time is called “Tajaka annual\nchart” or “Tajaka varsha chakra”. Analysis of this chart can\ngive insights into what may be in store during the one year\nfollowing the solar return. Results suggested in the annual chart\ncan take place only if they are ‘possible’ based on natal chart\nalso. However, annual chart often gives a finer insight into the\nyear in question than natal chart.\n\nA few special dasa systems enable timing of events within the\n365-day period of operation of an annual chart.\n\nSimilar to the annual charts, “monthly solar return charts”\n(Tajaka masa chakras) can also be drawn and they are useful in\nanalyzing a one-month period in depth.",

At the exact moment when Sun\nreturns to the exact position he occupied at the time of a person’s birth, a new year\nis said to commence in the life of that person.

The longitude and latitude of the birthplace must be used in casting\nthis chart, irrespective of the place of living at the commencement of the new year.\n\nThe commencement of a new year is called “varsha pravesh” by some people.\nVarsha means a year and pravesh means entry.\n\nLet us take a native with this birthdata: 8th March 1967, 5:40 pm (IST), 73 E 04, 26\nN 18.

It may be wise to exactly cast 12 monthly charts for the first year of the\nnative and then find monthly charts in later years from them, using the approximate\nmethod given for annual charts.\n\nA month is again divided into 12 shashti-horas. Each shashti-hora period consists of\n60 hours, i.e. 2.5 days. At the beginning of every shashti-hora, a Tajaka shashti-hora\nchakra78 (Tajaka sixty-hour chart) is cast. In the period corresponding to each Tajaka\nsixty-hour chart, Sun moves by 2º30'.\n\nIn other words, we can cast a chart after every 2º30' motion of Sun and use that\nTajaka sixty-hour chart to predict events in the 2.5-day period commencing then.\nThere are exactly 12 such charts in a one-month period.\n\nFor example, let us take the second month of the year 2000-2001 for the native of\nExample 118. The second month commences when Sun enters 23° 50' 25'' in Pi, i.e.\non 7th April 2000 at 10:38:06 am. The first shashti-hora of the month also starts then.\nIt ends and the second shashti-hora or 60-hour period commences when Sun is\nadvanced by 2º30', i.e. when Sun enters 26° 20' 25'' in Pi. This happens at 11:40:51\npm (IST) on 9th April 2000. If we cast a chart for that moment, we can make some\npredictions for the next 2.5 days.\n\nIn this chapter, we learnt what Tajaka annual and monthly charts are and how they\nare cast. When Sun re-enters every year the same longitude occupied by him at the\ntime of one’s birth, it signals the commencement of a new year in the native’s life.\nWe can cast a chart for that exact moment and predict events in the next one year\nbased on that chart. We can also cast monthly charts and sixty-hour charts.\n\nThese new years are based on the solar years and the commencement of new year is\naround one’s birthday as per the modern western calendar.

Lunar calendar is of great importance in Indian culture. Correspondingly,\nthere are techniques based on the birthday as per lunar calendar. However, those\ntechniques are beyond the scope of this book and we will restrict ourselves to solar\nbirthday and Tajaka annual charts.\n\n(1) The approximate birthday of the 27th year is 8th March 1993. He completes 26\n years then.\n(2) Adding the entries of 20 years and 6 years, we get 4 days 15 hr 58 min 12 sec.\n(3) Adding 4 days to Wednesday (weekday of birth), we get Sunday. The nearest\n Sunday to 8th March 1993 is 7th March 1993. So we take 5:40 pm on 7th March\n 1993 as the reference time.\n(4) Add 15 hr 58 min 12 sec to this reference time.

The correct varshapravesh\ndata is – 9:36:18 am (IST) on 8th March 1993.\n\nMuntha is a concept specific to Tajaka charts. Progress lagna in the natal chart at the\nrate of one rasi per year to get muntha in an annual chart. Suppose someone finishes\n31 years and starts the 32nd year on a given date. Suppose we are casting the annual\nchart of the 32nd year. Suppose the natal chart has lagna in Sc. Then muntha in the\nannual chart will be the 32nd house from Sc, i.e. the 8th house from Sc (after\nexpunging multiples of 12 from 32). So muntha is in Ge.",

    "output": "Muntha is very important in Tajaka charts. Muntha is as important a reference point\nin an annual chart as lagna. The reason may be obvious in the chapter on “Sudarsana\nChakra Dasa”. Some people find muntha in monthly charts by progressing natal\nlagna by 2º30' per month. This author takes a different stand and the readers may be\nable to appreciate this after reading the same chapter.\n\nLook at the planets in muntha. They tell us the nature of events in the year or month.\nFor example, Jupiter in muntha may give good results, happiness from children and\nknowledge. Saturn in muntha may make one sluggish, unhealthy, frustrated and\nsorrowful. Of course, the strength of the planets influencing muntha also matters. For\nexample, an afflicted and weak Jupiter in muntha may give loss of position, bad\nname and scandals.\n\nPosition of muntha in various houses with respect to lagna in the annual chart also\ntells us the nature of events in a year. Situation of muntha in the 9th, 10th and 11th\nhouses is excellent. It gives prosperity, status and gains respectively. Situation of\nmuntha in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th houses is also good. It gives health, wealth, success\nand fame respectively. Situation of muntha in the 6th, 8th and 12th houses is bad. It\ngives illness, troubles and expenditures respectively. Situation of muntha in the 4th\nhouse gives disputes and loss of position. Situation of muntha in the 7th house also\ngives troubles in marriage and many hardships.\n\nIn Tajaka analysis, we consider the following aspects:79\n\n(1) Trinal aspect: A planet has a strong benefic aspect on the 5th and 9th houses\n from it and on the planets in those houses.\n(2) Sextile aspect: A planet has a weak benefic aspect on the 3rd and 11th houses\n from it and on the planets in those houses.\n(3) Square aspect: A planet has a weak malefic aspect on the 4th and 10th houses\n from it and on the planets in those houses.",

A planet gets 20\nunits of uchcha bala if it is at its deep exaltation point (Sun: 10º Ar, Moon: 3º Ta,\nMars: 28º Cp, Mercury: 15º Vi, Jupiter: 5º Cn, Venus: 27º Pi, Saturn: 20º Li). At\n180º from its deep exaltation point, a planet is deeply debilitated and it gets 0 units of\nuchcha bala.\n\nWe can find the longitude difference between a planet’s position and its deep\ndebilitation point and divide it by 180º to get the fraction that shows how far away it\nis from its debilitation point. Bu multiplying 20 units with this fraction, we get\nuchcha bala.\n\nFor example, suppose Jupiter is at 8Vi30 (8°30' in Vi). So he is at 158°30' from the\nstart of the zodiac. His debilitation point is 5° in Cp, i.e. 275°0'. The difference is\n275°0' – 158°30' = 116°30'. Because this is less than 180°, we don’t have to subtract\nit from 360°.\n\nNow 116°30'/180° = 0.6472. Multiply 20 with this fraction, we get 12.94. So\nJupiter’s uchcha bala is 12.94 (out of 20).\n\nEach rasi is divided into several haddas and different haddas have different lords.\nHadda is similar to D-30. Table 72 can be used for finding the hadda lords of planets.\n\nHadda bala shows the strength in hadda. A planet in own hadda gets 15 units of\nHadda bala. A planet in a friend’s hadda gets 7.5 units of Hadda bala. A planet in an\nenemy’s hadda gets 3.75 units of Hadda bala.\n\nDrekkana bala shows the strength in drekkana chart (D-3). A planet in own rasi in D-\n3 gets 10 units of Drekkana bala. A planet in a friend’s rasi in D-3 gets 5 units of\nDrekkana bala. A planet in an enemy’s rasi in D-3 gets 2.5 units of Drekkana bala.\n\nNavamsa bala shows the strength in navamsa chart (D-9). A planet in own rasi in D-\n9 gets 5 units of Navamsa bala. A planet in a friend’s rasi in D-9 gets 2.5 units of\nNavamsa bala. A planet in an enemy’s rasi in D-9 gets 1.25 units of Navamsa bala.",

We can add\nor subtract multiples of 360º from a longitude to reduce it to the range 0º to 360º. By\nsubtracting 360º, we get 212°30'. This means that artha saham is at 212°30'. This\nmeans 2°30' in Sc or simply 2 Sc 30. Now we have to check whether the C is\nbetween B and A in A – B + C. We have to check whether lagna (280°50') is\nbetween 2nd lord (19°10') and 2nd house (310°50'). It is – if we start from 19°10' and\ngo till 310°50', we do encounter 280°50' on the way.

Lagna lord\nSaturn is at 19 Ar 10, i.e. 19°10'. Mars is at 24 Pi 58, i.e. 354°58'. Lagna is at\n280°50'. So samartha saham = 19°10' – 354°58' + 280°50' + 360º.

In the above example, the difference between the advancements of Moon and\nVenus in respective rasis is 19º–14º = 5º. This is more than 1º. So we don’t have a\npoorna ithasala. Now let us say that Moon is at 18º25' in Le (instead of 14° in Le).\nThen also we have an ithasala because Moon is behind Venus. The difference\nbetween the advancements is only 0°35', i.e. less than 1°. So we have a poorna\nithasala now.\n\n(iii) Bhavishya ithasala yoga is formed if vartamaana ithasala yoga is about to be\nformed when the faster moving planet moves by 1º or less. Bhavishya means future.\nBhavishya ithasala shows fulfillment after some obstructions or delay. Suppose\nMoon is at 13°35' in Le and Venus is at 21º20' in Le. There is a sextile aspect.\nMoon’s deeptaamsa is 12º and hence his sextile aspect on Li extends from 1º35' to\n25º35' in Li (subtract and add 12º, Moon’s deeptaamsa, from/to 13º35'). Venus is\nwithin Moon’s deeptaamsa. However, Moon is just outside the deeptaamsa of Venus,",

Moon is at 13°35' and\nthis is outside Venus’s deeptaamsa. So there is no vartamaana (present) ithasala.\nHowever, when Moon is the faster planet and he needs to move by just 0°45' (which\nis less than 1º) to come to 14°20'. Once he comes to 14°20', he is within the\ndeeptaamsa of Venus’s aspect on Le and we have a vartamaana ithasala yoga. So we\nhave a bhavishya (future) ithasala yoga when Moon is at 13°35' in Le.\n\nSpecial Notes: One should understand the meaning of these combinations and apply\nthem intelligently. The main criterion of ithasala is that the faster moving planet\nshould be behind. This means that the two planets will reach the same advancement\nin their rasis and have an exact aspect (sookshma drishti) very soon. If Moon is at\n14º in Le and Venus is at 19º in Li, Moon is going to reach 19º very soon and Moon\nand Venus are going to have an exact sextile aspect. So the energies of Moon and\nVenus are soon going to work in unison.\n\nThat is the main idea behind ithasala. If the faster moving planet is retrograde, then\nthe above is not going to happen and we no longer have ithasala. For example,\nsuppose retrograde Mercury is at 18º in Ge and Mars is at 18°10' in Li. One may be\ntempted to think that there is an extremely powerful trinal aspect and a poorna\nithasala yoga because the difference in advancements is merely 0°10'. However, that\nis not correct. Being retrograde, Mercury will go backward and Mars will go\nforward. They are not going to reach the same longitude anytime soon. Despite\nindications of success, one may be dogged with failure under this combination.",

It, in fact,\nshows a faster realization, as the two planets will reach the same advancement faster.\nSuppose Moon is at 18º in Ar and retrograde Mercury is at 24º in Ge. Now both the\nplanets move towards the other planet and they are going to reach the same\nadvancement soon. So there is an ithasala yoga.\n\nSuppose the faster moving planet is retrograde and it is more advanced in its rasi\nthan the slower moving planet. In that case, one may be tempted to think that there is\nno ithasala yoga. However, both the planets move towards the other and so there is\nan ithasala yoga. However, a planet’s speed reduces under retrogression and the\ndifference in advancements has to be smaller. For example, suppose Mars is at 21º in\nCp and retrograde Mercury is at 23º in Vi. They have a trinal aspect. One may be\ntempted to think that there is no ithasala here, because Mercury, who moves faster\n\nthan Mars, is more advanced in his rasi. However, being retrograde, Mercury moves\nbackward. Very soon, Mars and Mercury are going to have the same advancements\nin respective rasis (perhaps near 22º). They will have an exact aspect then.

In that case, Mercury and Mars are not going to have an exact aspect anytime\nsoon, because Mercury will start going backward after reaching 18°05'.

Remainder of 0 is equivalent to 9 and hence shows Venus.\n\nIn Example 122, natal Moon is in Uttaraashaadha constellation. So the first dasa\nbelongs to Sun. The number corresponding to Sun is 1. Number of completed years\nis 1993-1972=21. Adding 1 and 21, we get 22. Dividing it by 9, we get a quotient of\n2 and a remainder of 4.

About 0.79 of the constellation is yet to\nbe traversed by natal Moon. So the balance in Rahu’s Varsha Vimsottari dasa of\n1994-94 is 0.79 x 54 solar days = 42.66 solar days.

In other words, we take muntha as lagna when finding Varsha\nNarayana dasa. This is the link between the natal chart and the Tajaka chart.\n\nLet us take Example 122 and find Varsha Narayana dasa of D-9. Natal lagna is in\nAries. Because the native started the 22nd year in 1993, we find the 22nd house, i.e.\nthe 10th house (after removing 12), from Ar and get muntha in Cp.\n\nWe now find Varsha Narayana dasa assuming that lagna in rasi chart is in Cp. To\nfind Narayana dasa of D-9, we need the 9th lord in rasi chart. Vi is the 9th from Cp\nand Mercury owns it. He is in Sc in navamsa and Sc is stronger than Ta. So we start\ndasas from Sc. Normally the dasa order should have been Sc, Ge, Cp, Le, Pi, Li etc.\n\n88 Sum of the 2 cycles of Narayana dasa for natal charts is 12 x 12 = 144 years. However, only the\nfirst 120 years of this is valid, as the paramayush of human beings is 120 years.\n\nBut Saturn is in Sc and the “Saturn exception” applies. So dasas go as Sc, Sg, Cp,\nAq, Pi, Ar etc.\n\nSc, Sg, Cp and Aq dasas are of 7, 4, 2 and 3 years respectively. After compressing to\none year, they are of 21, 12, 6 and 9 solar days respectively. This covers 48 solar\ndays and these dasas run from June 1-July 20, 1993. Pisces dasa of 33 days started\nthen and it brought marriage.\n\nWhy Pisces dasa? Well, it contains lagna in D-9 and has subhaargala from lagna lord\nJupiter and Venus. Navamsa lagna’s dasa as per Varsha Narayana dasa of navamsa is\nan ideal candidate for bringing marriage.",

Lagna represents the physical body. Moon represents the mind. Sun represents\nthe soul. The three together represent one’s self. We should consider houses from all\nthe three reference points when judging a chart. For example, we need to look at the\n10th house from lagna, Moon and Sun to see career.

We should write down the bhava\nchakra with respect to lagna, Moon and Sun in the inner, middle and outer charts. To\nillustrate this, let us take the rasi chart given in Chart 72. Sudarsana Chakra for this\nchart is given in Figure 4.\n\nThe 10th house from lagna is in Sg and it has Ketu. The 10th house from Moon is Sc\nand it is empty. The 10th house from Sun is Aries and it is empty. We should analyze\nall the 3 factors together to draw conclusions.\n\nDasas of the 12 houses run in cycles throughout a native’s life. Each dasa is for one\nyear. For example, dasa of the 1st house runs in the 1st year of one’s life. Dasa of the\n2nd house runs in the 2nd year of one’s life. After 12 years, dasa of the 1st house will\nreturn in the 13th year. Dasa of the 2nd house will return in the 14th year. After every\n12 years, the same dasas keep coming.\n\nOne year stands for a solar year here. A new dasa starts after every one year. The\nexact date and time when a new SC dasa starts can be found by casting Tajaka\nannual chart. Look at the number of years completed. Adding one to it, you get the\nyear that starts. Divide it by 12 and find the remainder (if the remainder is zero,\nmake it 12). This remainder gives the house whose dasa runs in the year.\n\nFor example, let us take a native who finishes 44 years and starts the 45th year of his\nlife on a particular date. Because the remainder when 45 is divided by 12 is 9, SC\ndasa of the 9th house runs in the 45th year.\n\nWhen we say dasa of the 9th house here, we mean the 9th house from lagna, Moon\nand Sun. If lagna is in Pi, Moon is in Aq and Sun is in Cn, then the 9th house is in Sc,\nLi and Pi.\n\nHowever, analyzing with 3 signs becomes difficult. So one may conveniently choose\nthe strongest reference out of lagna, Moon and Sun and take dasas from it. This is\nonly an approximation, but it simplifies analysis.",

Antardasas\nin this dasa go as Sc, Sg, Cp, Aq etc.\n\nWe can use Tajaka monthly charts to find the date and time when an antardasa starts.\n\nSimilarly, we can find pratyantardasas from antardasas and use Tajaka sixty-hour\ncharts to find the date and time when a pratyantardasa starts.\n\nIn short, Tajaka annual, monthly and sixty-hour charts are nothing but the entry\ncharts of dasas, antardasas and pratyantardasas as per Sudarsana Chakra dasa.\nMuntha in Tajaka annual charts is nothing but the dasa sign as per Sudarsana Chakra\ndasa, but always reckoned from lagna.

There are some formulas in\nliterature for birthtime rectification, but these assume that human births happen in\ncertain quanta. For example, an approach may assume that nobody is born during a\nperiod of 3 minutes and people can be born in a period of half a minute then. Then\nagain, nobody is born for 3 minutes and people can be born in a period of half a\nminute following it. Like this, time is divided into certain quanta in which people can\nbe born. Then we find the nearest “human birth can happen now” quantum from the\nreported birthtime and use it as the rectified (corrected) birthtime.\n\nOut of these methods, some of the reasonable methods are the ones based on (a)\nTattva siddhaanta, (b) Pranapada lagna in navamsa, and, (c) Kunda.

This\nis a laborious process, but there is no other way.\n\nSuppose we are told that one was born between 9:02 and 9:08 am and suppose we\nare looking at his chart. Because we don’t know the exact birthtime, we can look at a\nrange. If we do that, we are potentially looking at thousands of people born during\nthat time. Our native could be anyone among thousands of people born in that range.\n\nBut all those thousands of people have significant differences. We want to identify\nour native among those thousands of people and the only way is to look at the known\npast. That’s the only thing that distinguishes him from others born closely.\n\nSo we should look at 9:02, 9:03, 9:04 etc and see which one explains the known past\nbetter. The rectified birthtime is the birthtime with which the known life events of\nthe native make sense.\n\nWhen we try different birthtimes, all the computations change.

The speed of Mercury,\nVenus and Mars is comparable to Sun’s. Jupiter and Saturn are even slower. Moon is\nfaster than all these planets. He stays in one rasi for 2.5 days or 60 hours. He changes\nrasi in D-10 once in 60/10=6 hours. He changes rasi in D-24 once in every 60/24=2.5\nhours.",

However, if a planet is at a\nborder and changes rasi in a divisional chart during those 5 minutes, we have to take\nthat into consideration. Suppose Moon is is at 23Sc59. Suppose That places him in\nthe 8th dasamsa of Sc, i.e. Aq. Suppose lagna in D-10 is Cn. So D-10 has lagna lord\nin 8th. This makes the D-10 chart weak. On the other hand, it Moon is at 24Sc00 or\nabove, he will be in the 9th dasamsa of Sc, i.e. Pi. This puts lagna lord in 9th in D-10\nand the chart is strengthened. Because Moon moves by one quarter of a nakshatra (or\n200 arc-min) in 6 hours (or 360 min), he takes 360/200=1.8 min to move by 1 arc-\n\nmin. For Moon to go from 23Sc59 to 24Sc00, it only takes about 2 minutes.90 If we\ncannot rule out an error of 2 minutes, we should consider Moon in both Aq and Pi\nand see which one explains the native’s career better.\n\nThus, we should pay attention if any planet is at a rasi border in the divisional chart\nof interest. If so, we must consider both the positions and see which one makes better\nsense based on known past.\n\nLagna changes rasi in divisional charts much faster than planets. So it is the most\nimportant consideration in birthtime rectification.\n\nLagna moves by one rasi (30º) in 2 hours or 120 min. To move by 1º, lagna takes\nabout 4 min.\n\nLesson: Lagna moves by 1º in 4 min. Lagna moves by 10' in 2/3 min (or 40\nseconds). Lagna moves by 1' in 4 sec. Lagna moves by 10'' in 2/3 sec.\n\nWe can see that lagna changes rasi in D-10 in 12 min. It changes rasi in D-24 in 5\nmin.",

Lagna at 4Sg39 puts lagna in these 3 charts in Cp, Cp and Sc\n(respectively). Suppose the birthtime is reasonably accurate and the maximum error\nis 5 minutes (i.e. birthtime can be 9:00-9:10). Let us find the possible lagnas in the 3\ncharts.\n\nAn error of 5 min changes lagna by about 5/4=1.25º or 1º15'. So, instead of being\n4Sg39, it can be as low as 3Sg24 or as high as 5Sg54. So we should consider all\nlagnas between 3Sg24 and 5Sg54. In D-10, lagna changes rasi at multiples of 3º. So\nthe whole range we have for lagna results in the same D-10 lagna (Cp).

So we have to add 1º21' or higher to lagna. Lagna moves by 1º21' or 81' in\n81x4 sec = 324 sec = 5 min 24 sec.\n\nThis means that the birthtime should be 9:10:24 instead of 9:05.

Then we have to add a few more seconds and see if we\ncross 6Sg00.\n\nOne may see from this example that an astrologer should know the details of the\ncomputation of divisional charts and be familiar with the longitudes at which lagna\nchanges rasi in various divisional charts.

On the other hand, using an approximate\nlinear formula for ayanamsa brings minor discrepancy in Sun’s longitude which is\nmultiplied by 360 in the longitude of lagna. This results in a serious error. Though\nwe do not know exactly when Nirayana zodiac coincided with the Sayana zodiac, we\ndo know the exact nonlinear formula of the precession. So one hoping to use Tajaka\ncharts in birthtime rectification must use the correct nonlinear formula of the\nayanamsa of one’s choice. Unfortunately, many people use linear approximations.\nThey are not good enough for Tajaka charts.\n\nIt is a good idea to first determine the correct D-9 lagna or D-10 lagna and then go to\nthe other divisional charts. We should first determine that the birthtime is between\n9:05 and 9:15. Then we can determine that it is between 9:07 and 9:11. Then we can\nuse a more precise criterion and narrow down further. Thus we narrow down further\nand further with each criterion.\n\nIf one’s marriage has already taken place, we can use D-9 to see it and fix D-9 lagna.\nIf not, we can see one’s general sense of duty, one’s basic skills and one’s interaction\nwith others and fix D-9 lagna based on them. Then we can go to a higher divisional\nchart. However, in reality, sometimes it may become necessary to come back to D-9.\nFor example, suppose someone can have lagna in D-9 in Li or Sc. Suppose we think\nthat Li is also a good candidate but Sc is better. Then the candidates for D-24 lagna\nthat we get with this choice may not make sense. It may make sense to place lagna in\nD-24 in another rasi and that may require lagna in D-9 to be in Li. In that case, we\ncan revisit D-9 and change the lagna.",

His D-4 and D-9 are shown in\nChart 75 and his D-10 and D-24 are shown in Chart 76.\n\nLagna with the reported birthtime is at 13Cp16. Let us approach the problem of\nrectification in a pyramid-like approach. First let us verify D-4 lagna. The native left\nhis motherland and went to USA in Jupiter dasa. In D-4, Jupiter owns 9th (flourishing\nabroad) and 12th (staying away from motherland) and he occupies the 7th house (long\njourneys). Rahu is the primary significator of foreign residence and he joins Jupiter.\nFor these reasons, Jupiter dasa can certainly take him abroad. So lagna in D-4 is most\nprobably correct.\n\nD-4 lagna changes rasi at multiples of 7.5º. The lagna we used above (13Cp16) is\nbetween 7.5º and 15º in Cp. So we conclude that lagna is between 7Cp30 and\n15Cp00.\n\nNext, let us look at navamsa. In navamsa, lagna changes rasi at multiples of 3º20'.\nHere is changes at 13Cp20. The given lagna (13Cp16) is just below it. We see from\nChart 75 that navamsa lagna is in Ar. However, with a very small error, it can be Ta\nalso. Let us consider both.\n\nIf we take navamsa lagna in Ar, the native should be dynamic (Ar), spiritual and\npossibly short-tempered (Ketu). With Venus and Moon in trines, he should be skilled\nat singing or other arts. But he isn’t. With Mercury in the 2nd house, he should be a\nskilled speaker.

So\nprobably lagna is above 13Cp20.\n\nWe have narrowed to the range 13Cp20-15Cp00, based on lagna in D-4 and D-9.\nNow let us consider D-10, the chart of career. The native is a dynamic software\nengineer. In D-10, AL shows one’s status in career and how people perceive one.\nHere AL is in Virgo and its lord Mercury aspects it. So he is perceived in his career\n\nas an intelligent person (Virgo and Mercury). The 10th house from AL has Mercury\nand Mars and it can explain a career in software.\n\nSo probably lagna in D-10 is correct. This confirms that lagna is between 12Cp00\nand 15Cp00. But we have no further narrowing down because of D-10. We still have\n13Cp20-15Cp00 as the rectified window.\n\nNow let us go to a higher level divisional chart and take D-24, the chart of education\nand learning. The native studied computer science at a good engineering college in\nIndia during his Jupiter dasa. With lagna in Ta, the 4th house of education is in Le.\nSun owns it. Rahu, Ketu, Venus and Mars aspect it. With this, education in medicine\nor management is likely. Education in computer science is unlikely. Moreover,\neducation in Jupiter dasa is unlikely.\n\nIf we take the birthtime above 13Cp45, lagna in D-24 changes from Ta to Ge. Then\nthe 4th house is in Vi, aspected by Mercury, Moon and Jupiter. Mercury and Virgo\ncan give education in computer science. Jupiter is in own house. He aspects the 4th\nhouse and joins 4th lord Mercury. So his dasa can give education.

We can\nalso use Kalachakra dasa.\n\nWith a birthtime of 10:36 am, we have lagna at 13Cp16 and Kalachakra dasa of Ta\nruns from 1987 to 2003. The native got married at the end of 1996. Ta dasa makes\nsense because navamsa lagna is in Ta. We should look at antardasa now. Pi antardasa\nstarts in May 1995, Ar antardasa in April 1997 and Ta antardasa in Aug 1998.\n\nBecause the rectified birthtime has to be between 13Cp45 and 15Cp00, let us first try\n13Cp45. We need to add half a degree to lagna. So we need to add 2 minutes to\nbirthtime and make it 10:38 am. The paramayush is 86 years and if we add 2 minutes\nto the birthtime, we should subtract 82x2 = 164 days from dasa dates.

With Ta being lagna and Ge being the\n7th house from Venus, marriage is most likely in Ta and Ge antardasas. So the start\ndate of Ta antardasa must be moved from Feb 1998 to the end of 1996. We need to\n\nsubtract about 400 days from the dasa dates. This requires further addition of\n400/86=4.7 minutes to the birthtime. This will add another degree to lagna and lagna\nwill be just below 15º. The rectified birthtime is around 10:42:30. The error in the\nreported birthtime can be due to errors in the clock used.\n\nOf course, if we use the rectified birthdata and verify a few more events in the life of\nthe native, we can be more confident that the rectification is correct.\n\nExample 131: Suppose an astrologer friend of ours approaches us with the rasi chart\nof a gentleman, shown in Chart 77.

He is in Makha constellation, which runs from 0º to\n13º20' in Le. His advancement in nakshatra is (13º13'25'')/ (13º20') =\n(793.4167')/(800') = 0.99177. The same fraction of the entire zodiac is 0.99177x360\n= 357.0375º = 357º 2' 15''. Adding this to lagna, we get Sree Lagna. Lagna is at\n17º35'50'' in Pi. So we get Sree Lagna at 14º38'5'' in Pi. Sudasa starts from Pi.\nBecause Sree Lagna is in an even rasi, Sudasa goes backward. We reckon quadrants,\npanapharas and apoklimas backwards and get Pi, Sg, Vi, Ge, Aq, Sc, Le, Ta, Cp, Li,\nCn and Ar. Dasa periods are as in Narayana dasa. However, there is an exception for\nthe first dasa. Because Jupiter is in Pi, Pi dasa is for 12 years. However, only a\nfraction of this is left at birth, based on the fraction of the rasi yet to be traversed by\nSree Lagna. This fraction is (30º – 14º38'5'')/ 30º = 0.51218. So the remainder of Pi\ndasa at birth is 0.51218x12 years = 6 years 1 month 23 days.\n\nWhy did the native start feeling financial tightness in 1996-97? Libra dasa was\nrunning then.

Sun stands for rhythm and Moon stands for melody. So a career in\nmusic is possible. As per Vimsottari dasa, Sun dasa started in 1998. This may be\nwhy her career was restarted in 1998.

So we should add a few minutes to the birthtime and\nmake sure that Kalachakra dasa of Aquarius starts just before her career is restarted.\n\nWe have so far looked at 4 examples. In the first example, we had to look at several\ndivisional charts to rectify the birthtime. In the second example, we rectified the\nbirthtime based on a dasa. We did it because the past events given to us relate to an\narea of life (finances), for which there is an appropriate dasa. In the 3rd chart also, we\nused the same dasa, but for a different reason. We did it because a key parameter was\non a rasi border. In the 4th example, we used Kalachakra dasa. Being a sensitive dasa,\nKalachakra dasa is usually very useful in carrying out a fine birthtime rectification.\n\nOne should choose the approach on a chart-by-chart basis. The information provided\nby a client about past events should decide the techniques to be used. Birthtime\nrectification is an area in which one can become good only after considerable\npractice. There are no hard and fast rules.\n\nThere are two kinds of birthtime rectification – macro-rectification and micro-\nrectification. Macro-rectification is the case when you have two or more totally\ndifferent birthdata from different sources and want to find out which is correct. For\nexample, there are different versions of Sri A.B. Vajpayee’s birthdata. If we want to\nfind out which is correct, we have to look at various divisional charts and life events\nand see which one works better.\n\nMicro-rectification is the one that we will need the most in practical consultations.\nThe birthdata reported by clients usually has a little error and we have to rectify the\nbirthtime.",

The only correct way to rectify a birthtime is to correct it in\nsuch a way that one’s nature and past life events are well explained. An astrologer\nshould have an idea of the change introduced in various computations if the birthtime\nchanges a little. Using lagna in D-9, D-10 etc, we can broadly rectify the birthtime.\nThen we can rectify it with a finer precision by going to higher divisional charts like\nD-20 and D-24 and using Kalachakra dasa. A couple of examples were provided in\nthis book. Readers should understand the examples thoroughly and practice these\ntechniques with as many charts as they can. The adage that practice makes one\nperfect is particularly true in this area. Readers should remember that correct\nbirthtime rectification lays a solid foundation for the entire chart analysis – without\ncorrect birthtime rectification, all other fine techniques we learnt in this book are\nuseless.\n\nGL in D-10 goes to the next rasi at multiples of 3º. Here it goes from Aq to Pi when\nGL crosses 21º. It goes from Pi to Ar when GL crosses 24º. So GL has to be at or\nabove 24Le00. So the amount we have to add is 24º0' – 20º 37' = 3º 21' = 201'.\n\nGL moves by 201' in 201 x 0.48 sec = 96.48 sec = 1 min 6.48 sec. So we should\nroughly add 1 min 7 sec and the birthtime should be 9:06:07 am or above.\n\nThere is an upper limit also. If it becomes too high, GL in D-10 will move from Ar\nto Ta. But we decided that GL in D-10 in Ar makes the best sense. So we cannot add\nanother 3º to GL. GL moves by 3º in 3 x 4/5 = 12/5 min = 2 min 24 sec. Adding this\nto 9:06:07, we get 9:08:31. So the birthtime should be between 9:06:07 am and\n9:08:31 am for GL in D-10 to be in Ar.",

If the birthtime\nchanges by m minutes, lagna changes by (m/120)x30 = (m/4)º. Moon moves by 3º20'\n(one quarter of a nakshatra) in 6 hours or 360 minutes. So, if the birthtime changes\nby m minutes, Moon’s longitude changes by (m/360)x(3º20'). So the fraction of the\nnakshatra occupied by Moon that is already traversed by Moon, changes by\n(m/360)x(3º20')/(13º20')=m/(360x4). When we find this as a fraction of the zodiac,\nthe change is 360ºxm/(360x4) = (m/4)º. The error in Sree Lagna is the sum of the\nerror in lagna and the error in this fraction of zodiac.

If the remainder of the first dasa at birth decreases\nby these many days, all dasas come these many days earlier.\n\nFormula: If the complete Narayana dasa length of the first dasa in Sudasa is n years\nand the birthtime changes by m minutes, all the dasa and antardasa dates change by\napproximately (6 x n x m) days.

Though we\nhave a big change in numbers, it is a continuous change and 360º = 0º. So we need\nnot worry and we can use the above formula.

One may\nmake typing mistakes everyday, but a particular day may be worse than usual. In that\ncase, the period of effectiveness of the event (viz making too many typing mistakes)\nis that day.

It may make sense to us, because Venus is the significator of marriage and\nbeing in an own sign or a friendly sign or a watery sign makes this watery planet\nstrong.

Evaluate the worth of this principle.\n\n[HINT: If events A, B and C are independent, P(A or B or C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) –\nP(A).P(B) – P(B).P(C) – P(C).P(A) + P(A).P(B).P(C)]\n\nWhile we discuss rational thinking, we may as well address this most asked question:\n“Why does astrology work? How can planets have an impact on us? Isn’t it irrational\nto think they do?”\n\nUnfortunately we don’t know exactly why planets influence us. We may not find that\nout in near future. Nevertheless, the subject of astrology becomes valid and justified\nif we prove some correlations statistically. Even if we cannot explain why planets\ninfluence us, we can still study the correlations between planetary motion and events\nin our lives. While it will be nice to be able to answer the fundamental question\nraised above, it is not necessary for astrology to be accepted as a statistical science.\nSome pseudorational people argue that astrology cannot be a science as long as we\ncannot explain why planets influence us. But that is not logical.",

We may not be able to explain the\ninfluence of planets on us on the basis of the scientific model of the universe we\nhave today. But that does not trivialize the statistical study of the correlations\nbetween planetary combinations and events in the lives of individuals.\n\nMany astrologers lament the fact astrology is not accepted as a science. But they do\nnot realize that a lot needs to be done before astrology is accepted as a science. A\nfew common problems are discussed in this chapter. It is this author’s hope that\natleast some readers are motivated to evaluate astrology using the tools given by\nmodern science. Spirituality, respect for Sages and scientific temper can co-exist.\n\nLet event A be: “dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by 3rd house”. Let event B be:\n“dasa rasi is occupied or aspected by 3rd lord”. Let event C be: “dasa rasi is occupied\nor aspected by BK”. A rasi is aspected by 3 rasis (by rasi aspect). So P(A), P(B) and\nP(C) are all equal to 4/12=1/3 here.\n\nSo the combined probability is (1/3)+(1/3)+(1/3)–(1/9)–(1/9)–(1/9)+(1/27) = 19/27\nor 70%. Though 75% is higher than 70%, it is not considerably higher. So there isn’t\nany statistically significant correlation.\n\n[Basically, combinations that are satisfied in 70% cases on average are poor\ncandidates for our studies. Even if the combination is satisfied in 90% of the cases\nwhen the event occurred, we cannot correlate the combination with the event with\nconfidence. On the other hand, if a combination is satisfied only in 5% cases on\naverage, we can suggest a good correlation even if the combination is satisfied in\n25% cases when the event occurred. Because 25 is 5 times 5, there is a strong\ncorrelation between the combination and the event in that case.]",

Those who have no\nbelief in Vedic remedies may skip this chapter.\n\nAn expert astrologer may be able to predict bad times and setbacks successfully. But\nwhat good is it for, if something cannot be done to avert the setbacks and bad times?\nA doctor not only identifies the disease one is suffering from, but prescribes drugs to\ncure it. Can we do the same thing in astrology?\n\nIn this chapter, we will take a look at remedial measures. Remedial measures are the\nmeasures that are taken to remedy the unfortunate situations that a native is going\nthrough or is expected to go through.\n\nThe pattern to be followed by one’s life is decided at the time of one’s birth by the of\nplanetary position then, which is in turn decided by the karma (actions) accumulated\nin past lives. However, it only decides the basic ‘pattern’ and not all the minute\ndetails. Though the basic pattern cannot be easily altered, the exact details can be\naltered by exercising free will. For example, one may be destined to have a vehicular\naccident on a particular day, but it can be a minor accident or a major one. Actions\ntaken by one’s free will have a role, along with the accumulated actions (karma) of\npast lives, in deciding the exact details. Remedial measures are the measures we take\nin order to manipulate the exact details to be relatively favorable to us.\n\nWhen we anticipate good happenings, we can afford to take a few risks. On the other\nhand, we can take extra precautions when we anticipate bad happenings. If an\naccident is possible in a period, we can drive very carefully or even avoid travel if\npossible. If quarrels with authorities are possible in a period, one can be extra careful\nand consciously try to restrain oneself.\n\nIn this manner, we can take common sense precautions to avert, or to reduce the\nimpact of, the bad events anticipated.",

We can wear the gemstones of such planets to protect us.\n\n(2) Good deeds: By committing good deeds, we can pacify planets.\n\n(3) Planetary Propitiation: By reciting the mantras and stotras of planets, we can\n pacify them. Mantra is a combination of sounds with a special power to produce\n beneficial spiritual waves within us. Stotras are hymns in praise of planets.\n\n(4) Propitiation of Deities: By propitiating various deities, we can pacify various\n planets.\n\nOne can wear the gemstones of favorable planets to get the blessings of those planets\nand tide over troubles. Look at the functional benefics in one’s rasi chart and\nprescribe their gemstones. If a planet’s dasa is running or if a planet is taking part in\na favorable yoga, we may choose that planet. Wearing the gemstone of a planet\nspeeds up the fructification of the good results promised in a chart by that planet.\n\nIf one wants good results in a particular area of life, we may strengthen favorable\nplanets in the relevant divisional chart. For example, suppose someone wants\nimprovement in career. We can prescribe the gemstone of a yogakaraka in D-10\nthen. If a functional benefic is badly placed or weak, its gemstone can still be used.\nFor example, if one has lagna in Cp, Venus is a yogakaraka. Suppose Venus is in the\n8th house (Le). Then he may not give good results in his dasa despite being a\nyogakaraka. In such a case, wearing diamond (gemstone of Venus) makes Venus\npowerful enough to give good results.

The planetary\nstrength should be good at that time. The planet ruling the gemstone should be strong\nat that time.\n\nWe can combine two gemstones and wear them, if the corresponding planets are\nfriends and functional benefics. This is partciularly recommended when the two\nplanets form a yoga. Suppose someone has lagna in Virgo. If 10th lord Mercury and\n9th lord Venus are together, they form dharma-karmadhipati yoga. A ring consisting\nof emerald and diamond may be advised. Similarly, if Sun and Moon conjoin in the\nchart of a person with Aries lagna, they form a raja yoga and a ring with ruby and\npearl may be recommended.\n\nTraditionally, astrologers assign the index finger to Jupiter, middle finger to Saturn,\nring finger to Sun and little finger to Mercury. Traditionally, gemstones of Mercury\nand Venus are worn on the little finger; gemstone of Saturn is worn on the middle\nfinger and so on. However, some astrologers suggest that the ring finger, middle\n\nfinger, little finger and index finger show the four purushaarthas – dharma, artha,\nkama and moksha (respectively). They suggest wearing a ring on the finger\nrepresenting the purushaartha of interest. One desiring marriage may wear the ring of\nhis 7th lord on the little finger. One desiring good results in career may wear the ring\nof a yogakaraka in his D-10 on the middle finger and so on. Index finger represents\nmoksha and it is usually left ringless.\n\nOne can pacify planets by good deeds. Good deeds of this life can compensate for\nthe sins of past lives.

When\nthese are not available, we can use lunar and solar new year charts and new month\ncharts. Solar charts are good at showing some matters and lunar charts are good at\nshowing some other matters. There are also some techniques based on transits.

That chart also has an impact on the nature of\nresults experienced by the nation during the leader’s tenure. We can find Narayana\ndasa of rasi chart and divisional charts of the swearing-in ceremony. We have to\ncompress Narayana dasa from 120 years to the expected maximum length of the\ntenure.\n\nExample 140: Let us take Indian Prime Minister Sri A.B. Vajpayee’s swearing-in\nceremony of March 19, 1998. Let us study D-9 and look at the relations with other\nnations (Chart 83).\n\nAn Indian Prime Minister’s tenure can be a maximum of 5 years. If we compress 120\nyears of Narayana dasa to 5 years = 60 months, i.e. compress each year to half a\nmonth, we get dasas as given below:",

However, solar new\nyear charts are prone to heavy errors if ayanamsa is erroneous. If ayanamsa has an\nerror of 1 arc-minute, this results in an error of 360 arc-minutes (i.e. 6º!) in lagna of\nthe solar new year chart. This is because lagna moves 360 times as fast as Sun. In the\ntime Sun takes to move by an angle of θ, lagna moves by an angle of (360xθ). So the\ndivisional charts of solar new year charts will not give consistent results until our\nayanamsa is exact.

In the case of a\nmarriage, the purpose of marriage is living together. Mangal sutra worn by a lady\nsymbolizes it in Hindu culture. So the time when the bridegroom ties the knot is the\nmost appropriate. In the case of a Christian marriage, the time when the bride and the\nbridegroom are pronounced a man and a wife after saying “I do” may be the most\nappropriate time. In the case of entering a new house (housewarming), the correct\ntime of entering the house is when one starts “living” in the house. One may not start\nliving in a house at the exact moment one enters a house with some suitcases. In the\nHindu way of life, only a house where cooking is done is a place of living.

For example, for joining a new job, lagna, 6th\nhouse and 10th house should be strong in rasi and D-10 charts. When starting a\nchild’s education, 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th should be strong in rasi and D-24 charts. When\nbuying a new vehicle, 1st and 4th houses (and A4) should be strong in rasi and D-16\ncharts. When entering a new house, the 1st and 4th from lagna and Venus in D-4\nshould be strong. When buying some real estate, the 1st and 4th from lagna and Mars\nin D-4 should be strong.\n\nWe can use Vimsottari dasa to time the progress of a task started at a muhurta. If we\nknow the maximum time period for which the task started at a muhurta can last, we\ncan compress Vimsottari dasa to that period.

If the task started at a muhurta\nhas no fixed time period of effect, we can take Vimsottari dasa of 120 years.\n\nIn addition to planetary strength, we should ensure that the first dasa as per\nVimsottari dasa belongs to a favorable planet in the chart. The effect of a muhurta\nlasts only for a few months or a couple of years and the strength of one’s natal chart\nis more important in the long-run.

Note that Cn contains 7th lord\nMercury in rasi chart. In D-9, it contains lagna & Mercury. So Jupiter’s Pisces dasa\nin 1999 can bring marriage.",

With Mercury\nowning the 7th house in rasi and occupying lagna in D-9, his PD can give marriage.\nHe is also DK.\n\nTo be sure, check Sudarsana Chakra dasa. On her birthday in 1998, she finishes 1998\n– 1973 = 25 years and starts the 26th year. Subtracting multiples of 12 from 26, we\nget 2. So dasa of the 2nd house runs. In navamsa, it is Leo. At the time of the start of\nthis dasa (i.e. Tajaka annual chart of 1998-99), Jupiter occupies Leo and Venus\noccupies Aquarius (see Chart 74). That is favorable. So marriage can take place in\nthe year (1998-99).\n\nIn Tajaka annual chart, lagna lord and 2nd lord have an exchange. The 2nd house\nshows family. Vivaha saham is in Sc. Mars owns it. Mars is also muntha lord. He has\na very close ithasala with Venus, the natural significator of marriage and upapada\nlord. In navamsa, Mars is very strong in his moolatrikona Aries. He is in the 2nd from\n\nlagna and 9th from muntha. Patyayini dasa of Venus runs during Dec 98 and Jan 99.\nPatyayini dasa of Mars runs during Feb-Mar 99.\n\nIn 1999, the lunar month of Maagha ends in mid-February. It brings the season of\nmarriages in India, because it is thought to be an auspicious month for marriages. So\nprobably marriage will take place in that month.\n\nSo the final prediction given was – “she may get married in the first half of February\n1999”. Because upapada is in Li in rasi chart, she was advised to pray to goddess\nLakshmi everyday and especially on Fridays.\n\nShe got married at the end of Jan 1999 and went to USA with her husband in early\nFeb 1999.\n\nA noted Vedic astrologer of the west was expecting a child in November 1999. At\nthe end of October 1999, he mentioned on an internet-based forum for Vedic\nastrology discussions101 that his child would be born in a few weeks.

This author wanted to illustrate the computation using the\ngentleman’s D-7, as he was expecting a child. His birthdata and natal D-7 are given\nin Chart 88.\n\nLagna in rasi chart is in Sc. The 7th house is in Ta. Its lord is Venus. He is in Ge in\nD-7 and Ge is stronger than Sg. So dasas start from Ge. Because Ge is a dual sign,\nwe use the trinal progression of Vishnu. Because the 9th from Ge (i.e. Aq) is an even-\nfooted sign, we go backward. So dasas go as Ge, Aq, Li, Vi, Ta, Cp, Sg, Le, Ar, Pi,\nSc and Cn. It can be seen that Le dasa runs during 1988-2000.\n\nIt can be seen that exalted Jupiter is stronger than lagna in D-7 and he can be used as\na reference. The 1st, 2nd and 5th lords from him are Moon, Sun and Mars and they are\n\nall conjoined in Leo. So Leo is a very important sign in this D-7. Its dasa can give\nchildren.\n\nLet us find antardasas. Because Le is stronger, antardasas start from its lord Sun. He\nis in Le, an odd sign. So antardasas go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc. During 1999-2000, the\n12th antardasa of Cn runs. It contains exalted Jupiter and it can give a child.\n\nPratyantardasas in Cn dasa start from Moon and again they go as Le, Vi, Li, Sc etc.\nMarch 13-April 13 is the first pratyantardasa. October 15-November 15 is the 8th\npratyantardasa of Pisces. From November 15, Aries pratyantardasa runs.

He also has an\nithasala with Jupiter, natural significator of children. In D-7, the 5th house is\n\noccupied by Mercury and Jupiter. Moon owns lagna and occupies 3rd (11th from 5th,\nshowing the gain of a child).\n\nAll these factors suggest a child in the dasa of Moon, who emerges as an important\nplanet in rasi and D-7. However, Moon’s dasa comes during June-July. Lagna’s\nPatyayini dasa runs during Oct 29-Nov 23 and Sun’s dasa comes after it. This\ngentleman said on Oct 29 that he was expecting a child in a few weeks. So it has to\nbe either lagna’s dasa or Sun’s dasa. Compared to Sun dasa, lagna’s dasa is a better\ncandidate. Usually lagna’s dasa brings important results. Antardasa is likely to be\nMoon’s. Moon’s antardasa runs on Nov 14-15. This agrees with the indication from\nD-7 Narayana dasa, viz child-birth before Nov 15.\n\nAfter this analysis, an e-mail was sent to the forum giving the computation of the\ngentleman’s D-7 Narayana dasa. It was mentioned that he might get a child before\nNovember 15.\n\nThe gentleman clarified later that the date given by doctors was November 23. He\nsaid that it was the third child and the ultra-sound scan predicted a daughter. The 3rd\nchild is shown by the 9th lord in D-7. Debilitated Mercury is the 9th lord from lagna\nin D-7 (counted in reverse). Debilitated planets show a daughter. Mercury also\nshows a daughter. We can now be more confident about child-birth in the\npratyantardasa of Pisces as per D-7 Narayana dasa, because Pisces represents the\nthird child in this D-7. So no changes were made based on the additional\ninformation.\n\nThe gentleman informed this author by personal e-mail later that he was blessed with\na daughter on November 14.",

It may be noted that Cp dasa of 10 years runs during 1989-1999.\nAntardasa running in March 1998-January 1999 is that of Aries. It is the 8th house\nfrom A10 (which can show the workplace) and its lord is in the 12th from A10. So a\nchange of job or turbulence at workplace is possible.\n\nBecause Ar contains AL and it is a trine from lagna, its antardasa is likely to be good\nfor career and status. However, its lord Mars is with Rahu in the 8th house from the\ndasa rasi Cp. So this indicates pressures and undesirable developments too. This\nseems to suggest worries at the current job and then move to a new job with higher\nstatus.\n\nThis can be cross-checked with D-10 of Tajaka annual chart of 1998-99 (see Chart\n91). AL in D-10 contains its lord Rahu and the other lord Saturn is in the 5th house\nfrom it. These factors suggest good status in career in the year. However, Venus\nowns the 7th from lagna (dealings with others) and the 9th from AL (fortune) and he\nis debilitated. This does suggest some setbacks. Moreover, Saturn and Sun aspect\neach other in D-10. This shows trouble from authorities.\n\nLet us check Tajaka monthly charts (Chart 92). In Tajaka monthly chart of May 26-\nJune 26, 1998, lagna lord in D-10 is Venus and he is in the 12th house with exalted\nSun, again supporting trouble from authorities. Moon and Mercury are with Ketu and\nRahu respectively and it does not suggest a happy mental and emotional state, as far\nas work is concerned. However, in D-10 of the next month’s chart, lagna lord Jupiter\n\nis in 10th in moolatrikona. Despite other weaknesses, this brings strength to D-10. In\nrasi chart also, 10th lord Mercury is in own rasi Ge (7th house) with 9th lord Sun and\nthis shows good developments in career.",

At the time of the original prediction, this author looked at\nNarayana dasa only upto antardasas. After he knew that the prediction came true, he\nchecked pratyantardasas (PD) in retrospect. Scorpio’s PD was running in June.\nBecause of the presence of 8th lord and debilitated Moon, its PD brought pressures\nand frustration. The conjunction of 8th and 12th lords can give a Viparita Raja Yoga,\nbut that can be effective only when the planets are in a dusthana in weakness or in a\nquadrant/trine in strength. Here Moon is debilitated and they are in a quadrant.\n\nAfter the frustration in Sc dasa given by debilitated Moon, next PD of Sg during July\nbrought success. He joined a better job. Because Sun is lagna lord and the lord of 5th\nfrom AL and because he occupies a trine from AL, this PD can be good for\nprofessional status. Because of his rasi aspect on Pi (GL), Sun can give a promotion\nalso. Moreover, Sun is the planet of authority. So Sg antardasa gave a new job with a\nhigher status.\n\nThe native came to this author again in May 1999.

In rasi\nchart, Venus owns the 8th house and he occupies lagna with Rahu in D-4. These\nfactors can suggest that his yoga will be in a foreign land. Vimsottari dasa of Venus\nstarted in April 1997 (using 360-day savana years) and the native left India and went\nto USA in April/May 1997.

That alone can say whether the native won the award on March 26 or not.\nIrrespective of whether one wins the award or not, a few weeks before March 26 and\na few months after March 26 are bound to be excellent in the native’s career.

So irrespective of planets, this\nmust be the dasa of marriage. In any case, Venus occupies Sg here and it can give\nmarriage. Antardasa can belong to the 7th house Virgo containg Mercury. It can also\nbe Gemini owned and aspected by the 7th lord. Gemini is the 7th house from Venus\nand from dasa rasi. Gemini antardasa runs from Sept 1991 to Aug 1992.\n\nNext, this author checked the Tajaka annual chart of 1991-92 (see Chart 96). Vivaha\nsaham is at 22Ge54, i.e. in the 7th house. Venus is the significator of marriage and he\nis at 21Ge11. The situation of Venus in the 7th house very close to vivaha saham very\nstrongly indicates marriage in the year, perhaps in the Patyayini dasa of Venus.\n\nMercury is the 7th lord and vivaha saham lord. He is at 13Ar37. Lagna lord Jupiter is\nat 13Cn52. There is a square aspect between the two planets. Because Mercury is\nbehind Jupiter by one quarter of a degree, there is a very “poorna (complete)\nithasala” between them. This also makes marriage extremely likely in the year.\n\nIn navamsa, Venus owns the 7th house and occupies lagna. Mercury, lord of 7th in\nrasi chart, occupies a trine in navamsa and joins navamsa lagna lord. (NOTE: If the 7th\nlord in rasi chart is well-placed in navamsa, it is good. The 7th lord in rasi shows the\npartner in physical life and navamsa shows inner self and dharma.)\n\nVenus dasa as per annual Patyayini dasa runs from 9th Nov 1991 to 7th Feb 1992.\nVenus-Mercury antardasa runs during February 5-7, 1992.
