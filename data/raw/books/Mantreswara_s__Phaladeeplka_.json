It is\n\ngenerally said by the astrological pandits that malefics do good if they are posited\n\nin the 6th house. The reason for this can be that the 6th house is 'Shatru sthana'.\n\nMalefics will destroy the enemies. It is also believed that Mars, Saturn and Rahu\n\nare good in the 3rd, 6th and 11th. The reason for this is also the same, namely, the\n\nmalefic will destroy enemies and diseases. Now we come to Shri Mantreshwarar's\n\nviews. According to him the lord of a house gives good effects when he is vested\n\nwith strength. This is unobjectionable but he has also expressed the opinion that if\n\nlord of a Dusthana is posited in another dustnana he does good. This has been\n\ndescribed in Verse 57 of this very chapter.

Cancer is\n\ncomposed of one quater or 3°-20' of Punarvasu, four quarters of Ashlesha. As the\n\nlongitude of 13°-12' in Cancer, it has passed the fourth quarter of Punarvasu in this\n\nsign and is in Pushyami nakshatra. To find out how much it has moved in\n\nPushyami we will deduct 3°-20' of Punarvasu from the Moon's 13°-12'. Thus the\n\nbalance will come to 9°-52'. The extent of the whole of Pushyami is 13°-20'. The\n\nlord of this nakshatra is Saturn whose total dasa period is 19 years. Therefore 13°-\n\n20' being equal to 19 years, 9°-52' will be equal to 14 years 0 months of 22 days.\n\nThis indicates that the 14 years and 22 days are observed over at birth and that\n\nwould remain at credit at birth will be 19 years minus 14 years 22 days, that is, 4\n\n All these detailed calculations will be avoided if we obtain the balance of\n\ndasa at birth on the longitude by referring to ready made tables in Lahiri's annual\n\n 4.

For\n\nexample, in the dasa of the Sun there will be the antar dasas of the Sun and all the\n\nother planets. The first antar dasa is of the same planet who is the lord of the dasa.\n\nFor example, in the dasa of Jupiter the order of antar dasas will be Jupiter, Saturn,\n\nMercury, Ketu, Venus, the Sun, the Moon, Mars and Rahu.

The period of antar dasa in a dasa should be calculated by the rule of\n\nthree. Suppose if we have to know the duration of antar dasa of the Sun in the dasa\n\nof Venus we should proceed as explained below. In 120 years the Sun's portion is\n\nof 6years. In 1 year the Sun's portion will be (6/120)*1. Therefore, in 20 years the\n\nSun will have Antar Dasa of (6*1/120)*20 = 1 year.\n\n The Sun's dasa is of 6 years and the dasa of Venus is of 20 years. Therefore\n\nthe figures of 20 and 6 have been taken above. The pratyantar dasa in any case can\n\nalso be calculated in the same manner.

According to Yavanas the\n\nLagna dasa Is included in the 50 years of Saturn dasa. This is not accepted by\n\nothers.
