The lagna Ayur should be calculated in the same way as in\n\n 26. The full period of life in the case of men has been declared as 120 years\n\n(12 x 10) by some. There are others who have stated that the full period will be the\n\ntime taken by Saturn to make 3 complete revoluation (in his orbit). There is a third\n\nschool according to which the full life period of man is the time taken by the Moon\n\nfor making 1000 revolutions.

Of the lagna. the Sun and the Moon whichever is strongest will have his\n\ndasa first.

The movable signs begin with Mars, the planetary lord of\nAries, fixed signs begin with the ruler of Leo (Sun), and the common signs\nbegin with the lord of Sagittarius (Jupiter). Following the cyclic order of\nzodiacal signs and their planetary rulership, the last division of movable\nsigns will have Sagittarius, ruled by Jupiter, fixed signs will have Aries,\nruled by Mars, and common signs will end with Leo, ruled by the Sun.",

Forces which can yield material affluence may\nalso be part of one's karmic retribution, and this is why Saturn sometimes\nbestows high status or worldly renown.",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nExplain the following Vedic astrology concept from vedic_astro_textbook.pdf\n\n### Response:\nSome people use some formula based techniques for birthtime rectification and\nassume that human births happen only in certain quanta of time. Most of those\ntechniques do not work. The only correct way to rectify a birthtime is to correct it in\nsuch a way that one’s nature and past life events are well explained. An astrologer\nshould have an idea of the change introduced in various computations if the birthtime\nchanges a little. Using lagna in D-9, D-10 etc, we can broadly rectify the birthtime.\nThen we can rectify it with a finer precision by going to higher divisional charts like\nD-20 and D-24 and using Kalachakra dasa. A couple of examples were provided in\nthis book. Readers should understand the examples thoroughly and practice these\ntechniques with as many charts as they can. The adage that practice makes one\nperfect is particularly true in this area. Readers should remember that correct\nbirthtime rectification lays a solid foundation for the entire chart analysis – without\ncorrect birthtime rectification, all other fine techniques we learnt in this book are\nuseless.\n\nGL in D-10 goes to the next rasi at multiples of 3º. Here it goes from Aq to Pi when\nGL crosses 21º. It goes from Pi to Ar when GL crosses 24º. So GL has to be at or\nabove 24Le00. So the amount we have to add is 24º0' – 20º 37' = 3º 21' = 201'.\n\nGL moves by 201' in 201 x 0.48 sec = 96.48 sec = 1 min 6.48 sec. So we should\nroughly add 1 min 7 sec and the birthtime should be 9:06:07 am or above.\n\nThere is an upper limit also. If it becomes too high, GL in D-10 will move from Ar\nto Ta. But we decided that GL in D-10 in Ar makes the best sense. So we cannot add\nanother 3º to GL. GL moves by 3º in 3 x 4/5 = 12/5 min = 2 min 24 sec. Adding this\nto 9:06:07, we get 9:08:31. So the birthtime should be between 9:06:07 am and\n9:08:31 am for GL in D-10 to be in Ar.",

When the kundalini located in the crown\nchakra of Shiva flowed downwards, it became such a burning fire that\nnothing could hold it; as an act of sacrifice, the earth consented to nurture\nit, for which reason Mars is known as Bhumiputra, the offspring of the\nearth. Mars has a cosmic as well as a human level of operation, and both\n\nof these derive from the energy inherent in the earth. Its most concrete\nmanifestation is found in frre. If the energy of Mars can be properly\nabsorbed, it becomes constructive, bestowing a great deal of creativity.\nFailing that, it destroys the person. Most of us are very uncomfortable\nwith a Martian person, even if he is not acting offensively. The\nvibration emanating from Martian individuals is simply unsettling to the\naverage person.",

There\ncan be various reasons behind a birthtime error: (1) using an unadjusted\nclock/wristwatch showing a slightly incorrect time, (2) forgetting to note the\nbirthtime exactly after birth and noting down it a little later with some manual\ncorrection applied to compensate for the lapse, (3) wrong memory of mother or\nfather when giving the correctly noted birthtime to an astrologer, (4) using the wrong\ndefinition of ‘birth’.\n\nBirthtime rectification is the process of correcting the reported birthtime before\nproceeding to make predictions based on the birthtime. There are some formulas in\nliterature for birthtime rectification, but these assume that human births happen in\ncertain quanta. For example, an approach may assume that nobody is born during a\nperiod of 3 minutes and people can be born in a period of half a minute then. Then\nagain, nobody is born for 3 minutes and people can be born in a period of half a\nminute following it. Like this, time is divided into certain quanta in which people can\nbe born. Then we find the nearest “human birth can happen now” quantum from the\nreported birthtime and use it as the rectified (corrected) birthtime.\n\nOut of these methods, some of the reasonable methods are the ones based on (a)\nTattva siddhaanta, (b) Pranapada lagna in navamsa, and, (c) Kunda.

It is also called “Sree Lagna Kendradi Rasi Dasa” or simply\n“Rasi Dasa”. Its computation is based on kendras etc from Sree Lagna. Sudasa is\nimportant for materialistic things like money, power and authority. It can be used to\npredict financial matters and matters related to status and power. If a political leader\noccupies a post of power, he must be enjoying a favorable dasa as per Sudasa. If a\nbusinessman sees increasing profits, he must be enjoying a favorable dasa as per\nSudasa. If someone struggles with tight finances, he must be going through an\nunfavorable dasa as per Sudasa.\n\n(1) In Sudasa, dasas start from the sign containing Sree Lagna (see the chapter on\n special lagnas).\n\n(2) The direction of reckoning dasas is forward or backward based on whether SL is\n in an odd sign or an even sign.\n\n NOTE: We are talking about odd and even signs here and not about odd-footed\n and even-footed signs.\n(3) First 4 dasas will belong to the kendras (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th) from SL.\n(4) Next 4 dasas will belong to the panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th) from SL.\n(5) Last 4 dasas will belong to the apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th) from SL.\n\n(6) Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system are found just like in Narayana\n dasa.\n\n(7) But there is an exception in the case of first dasa. Only a fraction of first dasa is\n left at birth. This fraction is found using the formula: (30° – SL’s advancement in\n its sign)/30°.\n\nExample 77: Consider Sri Vajpayee’s rasi chart shown in Chart 3. His SL is at\n12°21' in Capricorn.\n\n(1) Dasas start from Capricorn, the sign containing SL.\n\n(2) Because Capricorn is an even sign, the direction of reckoning dasas is backward.\n\n(3) First 4 dasas will belong to kendras from Cp, reckoned in the backward direction.\n They are Cp, Li, Cn and Ar.\n\n(4) Next 4 dasas will belong to panapharas from Cp, reckoned in the backward\n direction. They are Sg, Vi, Ge and Pi.",

If someone struggles with tight finances, he must be going through an\nunfavorable dasa as per Sudasa.\n\n(1) In Sudasa, dasas start from the sign containing Sree Lagna (see the chapter on\n special lagnas).\n\n(2) The direction of reckoning dasas is forward or backward based on whether SL is\n in an odd sign or an even sign.\n\n NOTE: We are talking about odd and even signs here and not about odd-footed\n and even-footed signs.\n(3) First 4 dasas will belong to the kendras (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th) from SL.\n(4) Next 4 dasas will belong to the panapharas (2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th) from SL.\n(5) Last 4 dasas will belong to the apoklimas (3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th) from SL.\n\n(6) Dasa periods of various rasis in this dasa system are found just like in Narayana\n dasa.\n\n(7) But there is an exception in the case of first dasa. Only a fraction of first dasa is\n left at birth. This fraction is found using the formula: (30° – SL’s advancement in\n its sign)/30°.\n\nExample 77: Consider Sri Vajpayee’s rasi chart shown in Chart 3. His SL is at\n12°21' in Capricorn.\n\n(1) Dasas start from Capricorn, the sign containing SL.\n\n(2) Because Capricorn is an even sign, the direction of reckoning dasas is backward.\n\n(3) First 4 dasas will belong to kendras from Cp, reckoned in the backward direction.\n They are Cp, Li, Cn and Ar.\n\n(4) Next 4 dasas will belong to panapharas from Cp, reckoned in the backward\n direction. They are Sg, Vi, Ge and Pi.",

The\ngreat yogi Matsyendra Nath, the first head of the Nath lineage of\nimmortal yogis, took the form of a fish and, listening carefully,\nstealthily absorbed that vidya into himself.

This principle, known as the Law of the Macro-\ncosm and Microcosm, is India's statement of the old Hermetic\ndoctrine: 'As above, so below'. Svarodaya implies that, among\nother things, those who know the movements of the Sun, the Moon\nand the other planets can use this knowledge to predict the nature\nof the movement of the breath in their bodies, or in other bodies.\nLikewise the movements of breath in the microcosm can be used to\ndetermine the positions of the planets in the macrocosm.",

In the Sixth, the planet makes the person\n free from diseases, vanquishes his enemies, wins in litigation, and puts\n him in association with good and sympathetic people. In the Eighth house\n sudden gains and introduction to the secret sources of natural power are\n possible; the individual may succeed in exhuming lost information and\n wealth, decipher forgotten mysteries, and receive laurels for difficult\n investigative studies and explorations. He accumulates much wealth.\n Lordship of the death-inflicting Eighth house does not make the Ascen-\n dant lord a killer for the individual. In the Twelfth house, however, the\n planet finds itself helpless, engaged in fruitless endeavors and often\n receiving unmerited ignominy.

Samudaaya Ashtakavarga is nothing but the sum of the\nashtakavargas of seven planets. In each rasi, we add the number of rekhas in the\n\nBAVs of Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. The sum denotes\nthe number of rekhas in that rasi in Samudaaya Ashtakavarga. It will be denoted with\nSAV. It is also called “Sarva Ashtakavarga” (sarva = all).\n\nLet us continue with the rasi chart in Chart 6. From the answer to Exercise 19, we\nsee that the BAVs of Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn have 5,\n3, 4, 7, 4, 8 and 3 rekhas in Ar (respectively). Adding them all, we get 34. So SAV\nhas 34 rekhas in Ar and we write 34 in Ar. We can find the number of rekhas in all\nthe rasis in the same manner and prepare a chart with the number of rekhas written in\neach rasi.\n\nExercise 20: Find the number of rekhas in all the rasis in SAV for the same rasi\nchart (see Chart 6).\n\nA rasi with 30 or more rekhas becomes strong. Matters signified by the house falling\nin such a rasi flourish and planets transiting in such a rasi bring good results. A rasi\nwith 25-30 rekhas is average. A rasi with less than 25 rekhas becomes weak. Matters\nsignified by the house falling in such a rasi suffer and planets transiting in such a rasi\nbring bad results.\n\nWhen choosing muhurtas43 for auspicious activities like a wedding or\nhousewarming, one should look at the strengths, as per SAV of the natal chart, of the\nrasis containing lagna, Moon and Sun in the muhurta chart. Rasis containing 30 or\nmore rekhas in SAV are favorable.",

If we cover the trines of lagna, then go to the trines of\nanother quadrant and cover all the 12 signs in that fashion (i.e. as the trines from\nquadrants), that sequence is quadrant-based and hence Narayana rules it. This\nprogression is seen for dual signs in Narayana dasa. On the other hand, if we cover\nthe quadrants of lagna first, then go to the quadrants of 5th/9th and finally cover the\nquadrants of the 3rd trine, then the sequence is trine-based and Sri Lakshmi rules it.\n\nIn other words, the sequence 1st, 5th, 9th, 10th etc is quadrant-based and it is ruled by\nNarayana. The sequence 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th is trine-based and it is ruled by Lakshmi.\n\nSo Kendradi rasi dasa uses the movement ruled by Lakshmi. Lakshmi is the goddess\nof wealth and prosperity. So this dasa shows the periods of prosperity. It shows the\nprogression of lagna using the movement ruled by Sri Lakshmi.\n\nNOTE: We will learn Sudasa in a later chapter. Sudasa is also a Kendradi Rasi Dasa,\nbut started from Sree Lagna instead of lagna. Sree Lagna is the Lakshmi sthana56 in a\nhoroscope. So its progression using the movement ruled by Sri Lakshmi is more\nimportant.\n\nExample 76: Let us consider the horoscope of former US President Ronald Reagan\n(see Chart 34).\n\nLagna is in Sc. Ta is stronger than Sc, as it has Jupiter’s aspect. So dasas start from\nTa. Because Ta is an even rasi, we go anti-zodiacally. Dasas go as shown in Table\n41.\n\n56 Residence of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity\n\nDasas from Ta to Pi add up to 65 years and run during 1911-1976. Sg dasa runs\nduring 1976-1986. Mr. Reagan became US President in 1980. Why did Sg dasa bring\nsuch success?",

Moreover, Cn\ncontains AL and shows status in career. Its strength is decided by SAV. SAV of D-\n10 is shown below:\n\nIn SAV, Cn has 38 rekhas. That is exceedingly strong. With the rasi containing AL\nhaving 38 rekhas in SAV, the status of this actor must be high. He must be a well-\nknown actor. And, Cn dasa must’ve brought excellent results and increased his\nstature as an actor.\n\nFinal Answer: This chart belongs to Bill Cosby, one of the most gifted entertainers\nthat the US television industry has ever seen. He had a successful acting career in\nfilms too. He came to limelight in 1965 with a lighthearted adventure TV serial\ncalled “I Spy”. He was the first black American to star in a prime-time television\ndrama series in US, and for his performances on the show he won the Emmy Award\nfor best actor in 1966, 1967, and 1968. The onset of Cn dasa brought him status.",

If we prefer to choose methods that work in spite\n of deviation in birthtime by a few minutes, we are ignoring a key fact – there are\n many people in this world who are born a few minutes apart in nearby places and\n yet lead significantly different lives. Still some people hide from this fact and\n stick to methods that give the same results to everyone born in a 15-minute or\n one-hour or two-hour period, because they don't have to deal with the\n complicated issue of birthtime errors then! But that's not the right approach – we\n should give importance to finer techniques. After all, Sage Parasara must have\n written about all these fine techniques only because he thought they were useful.\n\n(3) Some people define sunrise as the time when the center of the visual disk\n representing Sun rises on the eastern horizon, i.e., the time when lagna and Sun\n are exactly at the same longitude. Some other people consider sunrise as the time\n when the upper tip of the visual disk representing Sun appears to be rising on\n the eastern horizon, i.e., the time when the first ray of Sun is seen. The latter\n approach is recommended.\n\nExercise 9:\nSuppose (just suppose) that a key event from the known past of the lady of Exercise\n8 makes us think that her GL has to be between 16°15' and 17°30' in Virgo. Correct\nthe given birthtime accordingly.\n\nUse of special lagnas will become clearer in future chapters. For now, it will suffice\nto say that hora lagna shows money and ghati lagna shows power.\n\nIn any chart, normal lagna shows self. Hora lagna shows self, from the point of view\nof money, wealth and prosperity. Ghati lagna shows self, from the point of view of\nfame, power and authority. For example, when we time good and bad periods for a\nbusinessman, hora lagna may be very important. When we time good and bad\nperiods for a politician, ghati lagna may be very important.",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nExplain the following Vedic astrology concept from vedic_astro_textbook.pdf\n\n### Response:\nUchcha bala shows how close a planet is from its exaltation point. A planet gets 20\nunits of uchcha bala if it is at its deep exaltation point (Sun: 10º Ar, Moon: 3º Ta,\nMars: 28º Cp, Mercury: 15º Vi, Jupiter: 5º Cn, Venus: 27º Pi, Saturn: 20º Li). At\n180º from its deep exaltation point, a planet is deeply debilitated and it gets 0 units of\nuchcha bala.\n\nWe can find the longitude difference between a planet’s position and its deep\ndebilitation point and divide it by 180º to get the fraction that shows how far away it\nis from its debilitation point. Bu multiplying 20 units with this fraction, we get\nuchcha bala.\n\nFor example, suppose Jupiter is at 8Vi30 (8°30' in Vi). So he is at 158°30' from the\nstart of the zodiac. His debilitation point is 5° in Cp, i.e. 275°0'. The difference is\n275°0' – 158°30' = 116°30'. Because this is less than 180°, we don’t have to subtract\nit from 360°.\n\nNow 116°30'/180° = 0.6472. Multiply 20 with this fraction, we get 12.94. So\nJupiter’s uchcha bala is 12.94 (out of 20).\n\nEach rasi is divided into several haddas and different haddas have different lords.\nHadda is similar to D-30. Table 72 can be used for finding the hadda lords of planets.\n\nHadda bala shows the strength in hadda. A planet in own hadda gets 15 units of\nHadda bala. A planet in a friend’s hadda gets 7.5 units of Hadda bala. A planet in an\nenemy’s hadda gets 3.75 units of Hadda bala.\n\nDrekkana bala shows the strength in drekkana chart (D-3). A planet in own rasi in D-\n3 gets 10 units of Drekkana bala. A planet in a friend’s rasi in D-3 gets 5 units of\nDrekkana bala. A planet in an enemy’s rasi in D-3 gets 2.5 units of Drekkana bala.\n\nNavamsa bala shows the strength in navamsa chart (D-9). A planet in own rasi in D-\n9 gets 5 units of Navamsa bala. A planet in a friend’s rasi in D-9 gets 2.5 units of\nNavamsa bala. A planet in an enemy’s rasi in D-9 gets 1.25 units of Navamsa bala.",

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nExplain the following Vedic astrology concept from Light on Life_ An Introduction to the Astrology of India - PDF Room.pdf\n\n### Response:\nUpaya (Sanskrit for 'method') refers in Jyotish to the use of Agama\nand Kriyamana Karmas to remedy adverse astrological combina-\ntions. Though not formally one of Jyotish's limbs, this 'phantom'\nlimb may well be its most important and useful division.

If we\ntake a solar year to be of 360 days, with each day corresponding to the time period in\nwhich Sun moves by exactly 1º, we get the dasa of days of a planet by multiplying\nnormal dasa years by 3. For example, Sun dasa is normally for 6 years. By\ncompressing 120 years to 360 solar days, we find Sun’s Varsha Vimsottari dasa to be\n6 x 3 = 18 days.

They stand for the invisible and\nvisible selves. Niryaana Shoola dasa starts from the 8th house from one of them.\nNiryaana Shoola dasa essentially shows the progress of the 8th house. It shows the\nmotion of praana (life). That is why it has an uneven motion. It goes forward in some\ncharts and backward in some charts. Also the lengths of dasas can be 7, 8 or 9 years.\nAll this shows that different people have different motion of praana. When praana\nreaches Shiva’s Trishoola or a powerful maraka rasi, the native can die. In Shoola\ndasa, however, the motion has a constant rate of 9 years per dasa and the order of\ndasas is always fixed. This fixed motion is like the motion of a quartz crystal. It is\nnot the motion of praana and it must be a universal motion. It is suggested that\nShoola dasas show the force of Lord Shiva. The force of Lord Shiva starts from\none’s self and moves at a constant rate in a fixed direction. So Shoola dasa rasi\nhitting Trishoola rasis is less significant than Niryaana Shoola dasa rasi hitting\nTrishoola rasis. In the case of Shoola dasa, death occurs when Shiva’s motion hits\nAL or the trines from it or the houses of vitality from AL (3rd and 8th). AL is\ninvolved instead of lagna, because our existence is a maya (illusion) and what Lord\nShiva destroys is the illusion of our existence. The physical body (lagna) simply\nmerges with the material universe, when burnt or buried, and the perceived self or\nthe maya of existence (AL) is what is completely destroyed by Lord Shiva.\n\nLesson: Niryaana Shoola dasa shows the motion of praana (life). Death occurs when\npraana hits maraka rasis and the trines from Rudra (Trishoola rasis). Shoola dasa is\nthe reverse. It shows the motion of Shiva.

Of these, Saturn is a natural\nfriend and he becomes a sama (neutral) in compound relationship. Jupiter is a natural\nneutral and he becomes a satru (enemy) of Venus in compound relationship.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nExplain the following Vedic astrology concept from vedic_astro_textbook.pdf\n\n### Response:\nAnother important concept is “house” (Sanskrit name: bhava). In each chart, houses\ncan be found with respect to several reference points and the reference points most\ncommonly employed are lagna and special lagnas. Starting from the rasi occupied by\nthe selected reference point and proceeding in the regular order across the zodiac, we\nassociate each rasi with a house (first, second etc). Always the rasi containing the\nreference point chosen is the 1st house. Next rasi is the 2nd house. The rasi after that\nis the 3rd house. We proceed until the 12th house like that. Just remember that when\nwe encounter Pisces, we go to Aries after it. If no reference point is specified when\nhouses are mentioned, it means that lagna is used as the reference.\n\nIf, for example, horalagna is in Cn, first house with respect to horalagna is in Cn.\nSecond house is in Le (see Table 1). Third house is in Vi. Ninth house is in Pi. Tenth\nhouse is in Ar. Eleventh house is in Ta. Twelfth house is in Ge.\n\n(1) Lagna is in Cn, Sun is in Ar, Moon is in Ta and Mars is in Cp. Find the houses\n occupied by Sun, Moon and Mars.\n(2) Repeat the exercise, taking Moon as the reference point when finding houses.\n\nDifferent houses stand for different matters. Looking at the rasis and houses\noccupied by various planets, we can say a lot of things about the person. How\nexactly this is done will become clear in coming chapters.\n\nA “chart” (Sanskrit name: chakra) is prepared with the information of rasis\noccupied by all planets. For preparing any chart, we need to first determine the rasis\noccupied by all planets, upagrahas, lagna and special lagnas. In the visual\nrepresentation of a chart, there are 12 boxes (are some other visual areas) with each\nrepresenting a rasi. All planets, upagrahas and lagnas are written in the boxes\ncorresponding to the rasis they occupy.",
